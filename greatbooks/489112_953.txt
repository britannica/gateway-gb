mix themselves some toddy.) And let us have the cigars. Ejlif, you know where the box is. And you, Morten, can fetch my pipe. (The two boys go into the room on the right.) I have a suspicion that Ejlif pockets a cigar now and then!—but I take no notice of it. (Calls out.) And my smoking cap too, Morten. Katherine, you can tell him where I left it. Ah, he has got it. (The boys bring the various things.) Now, my friends. I stick to my pipe, you know. This one has seen plenty of bad weather with me up north. (Touches glasses with them.) Your good health! Ah, it is good to be sitting snug and warm here. Mrs. Stockmann (who sits knitting). Do you sail soon, Captain Horster? Horster. I expect to be ready to sail next week. Mrs. Stockmann. I suppose you are going to America? Horster. Yes, that is the plan. Mrs. Stockmann. Then you won’t be able to take part in the coming election. Horster. Is there going to be an election? Billing. Didn’t you know? Horster. No, I don’t mix myself up with those things. Billing. But do you not take an interest in public affairs? Horster. No, I don’t know anything about politics. Billing. All the same, one ought to vote, at any rate. Horster. Even if one doesn’t know anything about what is going on? Billing. Doesn’t know! What do you mean by that? A community is like a ship; every one ought to be prepared to take the helm. Horster. Maybe that is all very well on shore; but on board ship it wouldn’t work. Hovstad. It is astonishing how little most sailors care about what goes on on shore. Billing. Very extraordinary. Dr. Stockmann. Sailors are like birds of passage; they feel equally at home in any latitude. And that is only an additional reason for our being all the more keen, Hovstad. Is there to be anything of public interest in tomorrow’s “Messenger”? Hovstad. Nothing about municipal affairs. But the day after tomorrow I was thinking of printing your article— Dr. Stockmann. Ah, devil take it—my article! Look here, that must wait a bit. Hovstad. Really? We had just got convenient space for it, and I thought it was just the opportune moment— Dr. Stockmann. Yes, yes, very likely you are right; but it must wait all the same. I will explain to you later. petra comes in from the hall, in hat and cloak and with a bundle of exercise books under her arm . Petra. Good evening. Dr. Stockmann. Good evening, Petra; come along. Mutual greetings; petra takes off her things and puts them down on a chair by the door . Petra. And you have all been sitting here enjoying yourselves, while I have been out slaving! Dr. Stockmann. Well, come and enjoy yourself too! Billing. May I mix a glass for you? Petra (coming to the table). Thanks, I would rather do it; you always mix it too strong. But I forgot, father—I have a letter for you. (Goes to the chair where she has laid her things.) Dr. Stockmann. A letter? From whom? Petra (looking in her coat pocket). The postman gave it to me just as I was going out— Dr. Stockmann (getting up and going to her). And you only give it to me now! Petra. I really had not time to run up again. There it is! Dr. Stockmann (seizing the letter). Let’s see, let’s see, child! (Looks at the address.) Yes, that’s all right! Mrs. Stockmann. Is it the one you have been expecting so anxiously, Thomas? Dr. Stockmann. Yes, it is. I must go to my room now and—. Where shall I get a light, Katherine? Is there no lamp in my room again? Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, your lamp is already lit on your desk. Dr. Stockmann. Good, good. Excuse me for a moment—(Goes into his study.) Petra. What do you suppose it is, mother? Mrs. Stockmann. I don’t know; for the last day or two he has always been asking if the postman has not been. Billing. Probably some country patient. Petra. Poor old dad!—he will overwork himself soon. (Mixes a glass for herself.) There, that will taste good! Hovstad. Have you been teaching in the evening school again today? Petra (sipping from her glass). Two hours. Billing. And four hours of school in the morning— Petra. Five hours. Mrs. Stockmann. And you have still got exercises to correct, I see. Petra. A whole heap, yes. Horster. You are pretty full up with work too, it seems to me. Petra. Yes—but that is good. One is so delightfully tired after it. Billing. Do you like that? Petra. Yes, because one sleeps so well, then. Morten. You must be dreadfully wicked, Petra. Petra. Wicked? Morten. Yes, because you work so much. Mr. Rörlund says work is a punishment for our sins. Ejlif. Pooh, what a duffer you are, to believe a thing like that! Mrs. Stockmann. Come, come, Ejlif! Billing (laughing). That’s capital! Hovstad. Don’t you want to work as hard as that, Morten? Morten. No, indeed I don’t. Hovstad. What do you want to be, then? Morten. I should like best to be a Viking. Ejlif. You would have to be a pagan then. Morten. Well, I could become a pagan, couldn’t I? Billing. I agree with you, Morten! My sentiments, exactly. Mrs. Stockmann (signaling to him). I am sure that is not true, Mr. Billing. Billing. Yes, I swear it is! I am a pagan, and I am proud of it. Believe me, before long we shall all be pagans. Morten. And then shall be allowed to do anything we like? Billing. Well, you see, Morten—. Mrs. Stockmann. You must go to your room now, boys; I am sure you have some lessons to learn for tomorrow. Ejlif. I should like so much to stay a little longer— Mrs. Stockmann. No, no; away you go, both of you. The boys say good night and go into the room on the left. Hovstad. Do you really think it can do the boys any harm to hear such things? Mrs. Stockmann. I don’t know, but I don’t like it. Petra. But you know, mother, I think you really are wrong about it. Mrs. Stockmann. Maybe, but I don’t like it—not in our own home. Petra. There is so much falsehood both at home and at school. At home one must not speak, and at school we have to stand and tell lies to the children. Horster. Tell lies? Petra. Yes, don’t you suppose we have to teach them all sorts of things that we don’t believe? Billing. That is perfectly true. Petra. If only I had the means I would start a school of my own, and it would be conducted on very different lines. Billing. Oh, bother the means—! Horster. Well, if you are thinking of that, Miss Stockmann, I shall be delighted to provide you with a schoolroom. The great big old house my father left me is standing almost empty; there is an immense dining room downstairs— Petra (laughing). Thank you very much; but I am afraid nothing will come of it. Hovstad. No, Miss Petra is much more likely to take to journalism, I expect. By the way, have you had time to do anything with that English story you promised to translate for us? Petra. No, not yet; but you shall have it in good time. dr. stockmann comes in from his room with an open letter in his hand . Dr. Stockmann (waving the letter). Well, now the town will have something new to talk about, I can tell you! Billing. Something new? Mrs. Stockmann. What is this? Dr. Stockmann. A great discovery, Katherine. Hovstad. Really? Mrs. Stockmann. A discovery of yours? Dr. Stockmann. A discovery of mine. (Walks up and down.) Just let them come saying, as usual, that it is all fancy and a crazy man’s imagination! But they will be careful what they say this time, I can tell you! Petra. But, father, tell us what it is. Dr. Stockmann. Yes, yes—only give me time, and you shall know all about it. If only I had Peter here now! It just shows how we men can go about forming our judgments, when in reality we are as blind as any moles— Hovstad. What are you driving at, Doctor? Dr. Stockmann (standing still by the table). Isn’t it the universal opinion that our town is a healthy spot? Hovstad. Certainly. Dr. Stockmann. Quite an unusually healthy spot, in fact—a place that deserves to be recommended in the warmest possible manner either for invalids or for people who are well— Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, but my dear Thomas— Dr. Stockmann. And we have been recommending it and praising it—I have written and written, both in the “Messenger” and in pamphlets— Hovstad. Well, what then? Dr. Stockmann. And the Baths—we have called them
