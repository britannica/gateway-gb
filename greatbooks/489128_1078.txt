Both are the delight and pleasure of the society they frequent; it would be impossible to find more probity and politeness anywhere else. To-morrow they leave each other and their deed of separation is drawn up at the notary’s. Indeed, there are some merits which are not made to go together, there are certain incompatible virtues.
