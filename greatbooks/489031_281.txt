Work: “Arguments for and Against Galileo” fromThe Defense of Galileo Field: arguments for and against galileo Author: Tommaso Campanella Title: FOREWORD It is now essential to discuss two questions: first, should the new philosophy be permitted to search for truth, and secondly, is it desirable or allowable to suppress both the Aristotelian sect and the authority of heathen philosophers, and for our Christian schools to teach the new philosophy in harmony with Sacred Doctrine? A third fundamental controversy has been precipitated by those who condemn the exalted philosophy of Galileo the Florentine because they believe it opposed to the dogmas of Holy Scripture. I shall reply as the truth appears to me. I ask therefore: Is the philosophy which Galileo has made famous and important in harmony with or opposed to the Holy Scriptures? Five chapters will complete this inquiry. In the first I shall set forth the arguments and contentions which oppose Galileo; in the second, those which support him. I shall develop in the following chapter three hypotheses which lead to a double conclusion, and answer in the fourth the arguments brought against Galileo. In the fifth and last I shall discuss [and in part refute] the arguments which favor him.
