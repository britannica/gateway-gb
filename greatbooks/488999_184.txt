When she reached the palace, lo, Aucassin in tears, making great sorrow for the long tarrying of Nicolette, his friend; and the lady called to him, and said— “Aucassin, behave not so wildly; but come with me, and I will show you that thing you love best in all the world; for Nicolette, your sweet friend, is here from a far country to seek her love.” So Aucassin was glad at heart. Now is sung: Poem ```When he learned that in Beaucaire Lodged his lady, sweet and fair, Aucassin arose, and came To her hostel, with the dame; Entered in, and passed straightway To the chamber where she lay. When she saw him, Nicolette Had such joy as never yet; Sprang she lightly to her feet Swiftly came with welcome meet. When he saw her, Aucassin Oped both arms, and drew her in, Clasped her close in fond embrace, Kissed her eyes and kissed her face. In such greeting sped the night, Till, at dawning of the light, Aucassin, with pomp most rare, Crowned her Countess of Beaucaire. Such delight these lovers met, Aucassin and Nicolette. Length of days and joy did win, Nicolette and Aucassin, Endeth song and tale I tell With marriage bell.```
