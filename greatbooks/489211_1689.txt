pυ is constant, always supposing that the temperature does not alter. Let us suppose, for example, that the quantity of the gas and its other circumstances are such that we can put pυ=1 (the exact number on the right-hand side of the equation makes no essential difference). Title: Then in Fig. 2 we take two lines, OV and OP, at right angles and draw OM along OV to represent υ units of volume, and ON along OP to represent p units of pressure. Then the point Q, which is found by completing the parallelogram OMQN, represents the state of the gas when its volume is υ cubic feet and its pressure is p lb. weight per square inch. If the circumstances of the portion of gas considered are such that pυ=1, then all these points Q which correspond to any possible state of this portion of gas must lie on the curved line ABC, which includes all points for which p and υ are positive, and pυ=1. Thus this curved line gives a pictorial representation of the relation holding between the volume and the pressure. When the pressure is very big the corresponding point Q must be near C, or even beyond C on the undrawn part of the curve; then the volume will be very small. When the volume is big Q will be near to A, or beyond A; and then the pressure will be small. Notice that an engineer or a physicist may want to know the particular pressure corresponding to some definitely assigned volume. Then we have the case of determining the unknown p when υ is a known number. But this is only in particular cases. In considering generally the properties of the gas and how it will behave, he has to have in his mind the general form of the whole curve ABC and its general properties. In other words the really fundamental idea is that of the pair of variables satisfying the relation pυ=1. This example illustrates how the idea of variables is fundamental, both in the applications as well as in the theory of mathematics.
