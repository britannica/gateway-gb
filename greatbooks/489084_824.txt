that the numbers of men in the several classes in my table depend on no uncertain hypothesis. They are determined by the assured law of deviations from an average. It is an absolute fact that if we pick out of each million the one man who is naturally the ablest, and also the one man who is the most stupid, and divide the remaining 999,998 men into fourteen classes, the average ability in each being separated from that of its neighbours by equal grades, then the numbers in each of those classes will, on the average Grades of natural ability, separated by equal intervals.|Numbers of men comprised in the several grades of natural ability, whether in respect to their general powers, or to special aptitudes, ---|--- a|A|4|256,791|651,000|495,000|391,000|268,000|171,000|77,000 b|B|6|161,279|469,000|312,000|246,000|168,000|107,000|48,000 c|C|16|63,563|161,000|123,000|97,000|66,000|42,000|19,000 d|D|64|15,696|39,800|30,300|23,900|16,400|10,400|4,700 e|E|413|2,423|6,100|4,700|3,700|2,520|1,600|729 f|F|4,300|233|590|450|355|243|155|70 g|G|79,000|14|35|27|21|15|9|4 x all grades below g|X all grades above G|1,000,000|1|3|2|2|2|−|– On either side of average..........|500,000|1,268,000|964,000|761,000|521,000|332,000|149,000 Total, both sides...............|1,000,000|2,536,000|1,928,000|1,522,000|1,042,000|664,000|298,000 of many millions, be as is stated in the table. The table may be applied to special, just as truly as to general ability. It would be true for every examination that brought out natural gifts, whether held in painting, in music, or in statesmanship. The proportions between the different classes would be identical in all these cases, although the classes would be made up of different individuals, according as the examination differed in its purport. It will be seen that more than half of each million is contained in the two mediocre classes a and A; the four mediocre classes a, b, A, B, contain more than four-fifths, and the six mediocre classes more than nineteen-twentieths of the entire population. Thus, the rarity of commanding ability, and the vast abundance of mediocrity, is no accident, but follows of necessity, from the very nature of these things. The meaning of the word “mediocrity” admits of little doubt. It defines the standard of intellectual power found in most provincial gatherings, because the attractions of a more stirring life in the metropolis and elsewhere, are apt to draw away the abler classes of men, and the silly and the imbecile do not take a part in the gatherings. Hence, the residuum that forms the bulk of the general society of small provincial places, is commonly very pure in its mediocrity. The class C possesses abilities a trifle higher than those commonly possessed by the foreman of an ordinary jury. D includes the mass of men who obtain the ordinary prizes of life. E is a stage higher. Then we reach F, the lowest of those yet superior classes of intellect, with which this volume is chiefly concerned. On descending the scale, we find by the time we have reached f, that we are already among the idiots and imbeciles. We have seen…that there are 400 idiots and imbeciles to every million of persons living in this country; but that 30 per cent of their number appear to be light cases, to whom the name of idiot is inappropriate. There will remain 280 true idiots and imbeciles, to every million of our population. This ratio coincides very closely with the requirements of class f. No doubt a certain proportion of them are idiotic owing to some fortuitous cause, which may interfere with the working of a naturally good brain, much as a bit of dirt may cause a first-rate chronometer to keep worse time than an ordinary watch. But I presume, from the usual smallness of head and absence of disease among these persons, that the proportion of accidental idiots cannot be very large. Hence we arrive at the undeniable, but unexpected conclusion, that eminently gifted men are raised as much above mediocrity as idiots are depressed below it; a fact that is calculated to considerably enlarge our ideas of the enormous differences of intellectual gifts between man and man. I presume the class F of dogs, and others of the more intelligent sort of animals, is nearly commensurate with the f of the human race, in respect to memory and powers of reason. Certainly the class G of such animals is far superior to the g of humankind.
