Author: Sir Francis Bacon Of the fixed things in Bacon’s fixed world, nothing is more stable than mankind, nor did Bacon need to wait half a century for Locke to tell him that “human nature is always and everywhere the same.” No doubt men are always different too, as between one individual and another, but as a whole they are all alike, and it is with the whole that Bacon is concerned in these essays on moral subjects. Hence his talk is generalized—stripped to the bone of common truth. Of truth itself, he says candidly: “A mixture of a lie doth ever add pleasure.” On other moral matters, he speaks with equal if chillingr realism. “Men fear Death as children fear to go in the dark,” he tells us, “and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so irs the other.” Bacon does not seek to change men, but to govern them. “To seek to extinguish Anger utterly is but a bravery of the Stoics,” he says. “We have better oracles: ‘Be angry, but sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your anger.’ Anger must be limited and confined,” he suggests instead, meaning that we must live with it. Bacon does not reach noble heights, or try to. His talk is of the middle ground, where good and evil are always mixed—where men are what they are, not what they ought to be. They might act better than they do, certainly; nor does Bacon fail to suggest how. But he mostly has in mind their satisfaction and their safety rather than their souls. The reader should not decide too quickly that this is cynical. Perhaps souls are not much the business of the civil lawyer, who is concerned with something nearer than salvation—with this world rather than the next. Goodness is not impossible in the world, except as the iniquity of the world is not recognized or faced. The point simply is—as Bacon might be taken to imply, following every philosopher since Plato—that the best man is in the end the wisest, and the one most knowing of humankind.
