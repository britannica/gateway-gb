Work: What Is War? Field: what is war Author: Karl von Clausewitz Title: SO ONLY THE ELEMENT OF CHANCE IS NOW LACKING TO MAKE OF WAR A GAMBLE, AND IN THIS ELEMENT IT IS LEAST OF ALL DEFICIENT We see from the foregoing how much the objective nature of war makes it a calculation of probabilities. It now needs but one single element more to make of it a gamble, and that element it certainly does not lackâ€”the element of chance. There is no human activity that stands in such constant and universal contact with chance as does war. Thus together with chance, the accidental and, with it, good luck play a great part in war.
