with large plaited skirts, laced with gold lace. Célimène (to alcestes). Go see what he wants, or bid him come in. Title: SCENE VII Alcestes (going up to the Guard). Well then, what’s your pleasure? come hither, sir. Guard. Sir, I want to speak a word or two with you. Alcestes. You may speak aloud, sir, to let me know what it is. Guard. The marshals of France, whose commands I am charged with, order you, sir, to come and appear before them immediately. Alcestes. Who? me, sir? Guard. Yourself, sir. Alcestes. And what for? Philintes (to alcestes). ’Tis the ridiculous affair between you and Orontes. Célimène (to philintes). How? Philintes. Orontes and he affronted one another just now about some trifling verses he did not approve of, and they want to quash the thing in its infancy. Alcestes. I shall never show any base compliance. Philintes. But you must obey order, come, get ready— Alcestes. What accommodation would they propose between us? Shall the vote of these gentlemen condemn me to approve the verses which are the occasion of our quarrel? I won’t unsay what I have said; I think ’em villainous. Philintes. But you should with more temper— Alcestes. I shan’t abate an ace of it, the verses are execrable. Philintes. You should show yourself tractable in your sentiments. Come, let’s away. Alcestes.

(To clitander and acastes, who laugh.) S’heart, gentlemen, I did not think to be so diverting as I am. Célimène. Go quickly, and make your appearance where you should. Alcestes. I am going thither, madam, and I shall return hither immediately to decide our debates.
