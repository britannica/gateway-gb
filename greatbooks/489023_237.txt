or vegetable, as on mineral, species. His power over living beings will remain more limited, especially where they form higher, i.e., more complicated, organisms. Nevertheless, the difficulties obstructing the power of physiologists do not pertain to the nature of vital phenomena, but merely to their complexity. Physiologists will first begin by getting at phenomena of vegetables and of animals in easier relations with the outer cosmic environment. It appears, at first sight, as if man and the higher animals must escape from its power to change, because they seem freed from the direct influence of the outer environment. But we know that vital phenomena in man, as in the animals nearest him, are connected with the physico-chemical conditions of an inner organic environment. This inner environment we must first seek to know, because this must become the real field of action for physiology and experimental medicine. The foregoing is Chapter III from Bernardâ€™s an introduction to the study of experimental medicine , translated by Henry C. Greene .
