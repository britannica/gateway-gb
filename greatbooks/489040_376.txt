Work: What Is War? Field: what is war Author: Karl von Clausewitz Title: ALL WARS MAY BE REGARDED AS POLITICAL ACTS To return to our main subject: Though it is true that in one kind of war policy seems entirely to disappear, while in another it very definitely comes to the front, we can nevertheless maintain that the one kind is as political as the other. For if we regard policy as the intelligence of the personified state; we must include among the combinations of circumstances which its calculations have to take into account that in which the nature of all the circumstances postulates a war of the first kind. It is only if we understand the term policy not as a comprehensive knowledge of the situation but the conventional idea of a cautious, crafty, even dishonest cunning, averse to violence, that the latter kind of war could belong to it more than does the former.
