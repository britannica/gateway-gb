Work: Characters Field: characters Author: La Bruyère Title: ARSÈNE Arsène contemplates mankind from the summit of his mind and, seen from that eminence, men frighten him, so to speak, by their littleness. Praised and exalted to the skies by certain people who have arranged to admire each other reciprocally, he believes he possesses not only the good qualities he really has but all a man can have, which he will never have; thus occupied and filled with his sublime thoughts he barely gives himself time to deliver a few oracular statements; uplifted above human judgments by his character, he leaves to common minds the merit of an orderly, coherent life, and is himself responsible for his irregularities only to the circle of friends who regard them in a spirit of idolatry. They alone are competent to judge, can think and write; they alone ought to be writers. There is no other literary work, however well received in the world, however universally enjoyed by men of taste, which he—I will not say approves—but even condescends to read. He cannot be reformed by this portrait, for he will not read it.
