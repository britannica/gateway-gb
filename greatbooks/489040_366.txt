Work: What Is War? Field: what is war Author: Karl von Clausewitz Title: ATTACK AND DEFENSE ARE THINGS DIFFERENT IN KIND AND OF UNEQUAL FORCE. POLARITY THEREFORE IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THEM If there were only one form of war, namely, the attack of the enemy, therefore no defense; in other words if the attack were distinguished from the defense merely by the positive motive, which the one has and the other has not, but the methods of the fight were always one and the same, in such a fight every advantage to the one side would be an equal disadvantage to the other and true polarity would exist. But military activity takes two separate forms, attack and defense, which, as we shall later on explain in detail, are very different and of unequal strength. Polarity lies therefore in that to which they both bear a relation, namely, the decision, but not in attack or defense itself. If one commander wishes to postpone the decision, the other must wish to hasten it, but, of course, only in the same form of conflict. If it is to A’s interest not to attack his opponent at once but four weeks hence, it is to B’s interest to be attacked by him at once and not four weeks hence. Here is a direct opposition; but it does not follow therefrom that it is to B’s interest to attack A at once. That is obviously something quite different.
