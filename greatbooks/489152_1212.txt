willing to deny things any longer; and let us not come, pray, to troublesome extremities. Sganarel. To what? Valere. To certain things which we should be sorry for. Sganarel. S’death, come to what you please; I am not a doctor, and don’t understand what you would be at. Valere (aside). I see plainly that we must make use of the remedy. (Aloud.) Sir, once more I desire you to own what you are. Lucas. And s’bobs, don’t latterlammas it any longer, but confess frankly that you be a doctor. Sganarel (aside). I’m mad— Valere. Where’s the good of denying what is known? Lucas. Wherefore all these whimsies? What service will this do you. Sganarel. Gentlemen in one word, as well as in two thousand, I tell you that I am not a doctor. Valere. You are not a doctor? Sganarel. No. Lucas. Y’an’t a doctor? Sganarel. No, I tell you. Valere. Since you will have it, we must betake ourselves to it then. (They take each of them a cudgel and thrash him.) Sganarel. Hold, hold, hold, Gentlemen, I’m what you please. Valere. Why, Sir, did you oblige us to this violence? Lucas. To what good did you make us be at the pain to beat you? Valere. I assure you that I did it with all the regret in the world. Lucas. By my foith and vronkly, I did it with zorrow. Sganarel. What the deuce d’e mean, Sirs? Pray, is it out of a joke, or are you both distracted, that you will have me to be a doctor? Valere. What, won’t you yield yet, and do you deny that you are a physician? Sganarel. The devil take me if I am one. Lucas. En’t it true that you do understond physic. Sganarel. No, plague choke me if I do. (They begin to beat him again.) Hold, hold; well Gentlemen, yes, since you will have it so, I am a doctor, I am a doctor; an apothecary too, if you think good. I rather choose to agree to everything than suffer myself to be knocked o’ the head. Valere. Ay, now things go well, Sir; I’m transported to see you’re become reasonable. Lucas. You give me a heart full of joy to zee you talk in this monner. Valere. I ask your pardon with all my soul. Lucas. I’se demand excuse for the liberty Ic’ have ta’en. Sganarel (aside). Whu, have I really deceived myself then, and am I become a doctor without knowing it? Valere. You shall not repent, Sir, discovering to us what you are; and you’ll certainly see that you’ll be satisfied for it. Sganarel. But, Gentlemen, tell me, don’t you deceive yourselves? Is it very sure that I am a doctor? Lucas. Yes, by my foith. Sganarel. In good earnest? Valere. Undoubtedly. Sganarel. The devil take me if I knew it. Valere. How! You are the most able physician in the world. Sganarel. Ay! Ay! Lucas. A doctor that has healed I know not how many ailments. Sganarel. O dear! Valere. A woman was taken for dead six hours, she was just ready to be buried, when with one drop of a certain thing you brought her to life again, and made her walk immediately about the room. Sganarel. The plague I did! Lucas. A little lad of a dozen-year old fell from the top of a steeple, whereupon a had his head, lags, and arms broaken; and you, with I know not what nointment, made ’en soon scramble up on his feet, and scour away to play at chuck. Sganarel. The devil! Valere. In short, Sir, you shall have satisfaction with us; and you may gain whatever you will if you’ll but suffer us to conduct you to where we want you. Sganarel. I may gain what I will? Valere. Yes. Sganarel. Oh! I’m a doctor without dispute. I had forgotten it, but I remember it now. What’s the affair? Where must I transport myself to? Valere. We’ll conduct you. The affair is to go see a young lady who has lost her speech. Sganarel. Faith I have not found it. Valere (to lucas). He loves to joke. (To sganarel.) Come, Sir. Sganarel. Without a doctor’s gown? Valere. We’ll procure you one. Sganarel (offering his bottle to valere). Do you hold that. That’s where I put my julep. (Then turns towards lucas and spits.) Walk you over that by prescription of the doctor. Lucas. By the mass this is a doctor that pleases me; I believe that he’ll succeed, he’s such a merry fellow.
