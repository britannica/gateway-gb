Anya (pensively). There goes Yepihodov. Gayev. Ladies and gentlemen, the sun has set. Trofimov. Yes. Gayev (in a low voice, declaiming as it were). Oh, Nature, wondrous Nature, you shine with eternal radiance, beautiful and indifferent! You, whom we call our mother, unite within yourself life and death! You animate and destroy! Varya (pleadingly). Uncle dear! Anya. Uncle, again! Trofimov. You’d better bank the yellow ball in the side pocket. Gayev. I’m silent, I’m silent… All sit plunged in thought. Stillness reigns. Only firs’s muttering is audible . Suddenly a distant sound is heard, coming from the sky as it were, the sound of a snapping string, mournfully dying away. Mme. Ranevskaya. What was that? Lopahin. I don’t know. Somewhere far away, in the pits, a bucket’s broken loose; but somewhere very far away. Gayev. Or it might be some sort of bird, perhaps a heron. Trofimov. Or an owl… Mme. Ranevskaya (shudders). It’s weird, somehow. (Pause.) Firs. Before the calamity the same thing happened—the owl screeched, and the samovar hummed all the time. Gayev. Before what calamity? Firs. Before the Freedom. (Pause.) Mme. Ranevskaya. Come, my friends, let’s be going. It’s getting dark. (To anya.) You have tears in your eyes. What is it, my little one? (Embraces her.) Anya. I don’t know, Mamma; it’s nothing. Trofimov. Somebody’s coming. A tramp appears, wearing a shabby white cap and an overcoat . He is slightly drunk. Tramp. Allow me to inquire, will this short cut take me to the station? Gayev. It will. Just follow that road. Tramp. My heartfelt thanks. (Coughing.) The weather is glorious. (Recites) “My brother, my suffering brother…Go down to the Volga! Whose groans…?” (To varya.) Mademoiselle, won’t you spare 30 kopecks for a hungry Russian? varya , frightened, cries out . Lopahin (angrily). Even panhandling has its proprieties. Mme. Ranevskaya (scared). Here, take this. (Fumbles in her purse.) I haven’t any silver…never mind, here’s a gold piece. Tramp. My heartfelt thanks. (Exits. Laughter.) Varya (frightened). I’m leaving, I’m leaving…Oh, Mamma dear, at home the servants have nothing to eat, and you gave him a gold piece! Mme. Ranevskaya. What are you going to do with me? I’m such a fool. When we get home, I’ll give you everything I have. Yermolay Alexeyevich, you’ll lend me some more… Lopahin. Yes, Ma’am. Mme. Ranevskaya. Come, ladies and gentlemen, it’s time to be going. Oh! Varya, we’ve settled all about your marriage. Congratulations! Varya (through tears). Really, Mamma, that’s not a joking matter. Lopahin. “Aurelia, get thee to a nunnery, go…” Gayev. And do you know, my hands are trembling: I haven’t played billiards in a long time. Lopahin. “Aurelia, nymph, in your orisons, remember me!” Mme. Ranevskaya. Let’s go, it’s almost suppertime. Varya. He frightened me! My heart’s pounding. Lopahin. Let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, on the 22nd of August the cherry orchard will be up for sale. Think about that! Think! All except trofimov and anya go out . Anya (laughs). I’m grateful to that tramp, he frightened Varya and so we’re alone. Trofimov. Varya’s afraid we’ll fall in love with each other all of a sudden. She hasn’t left us alone for days. Her narrow mind can’t grasp that we’re above love. To avoid the petty and illusory, everything that prevents us from being free and happy—that is the goal and meaning of our life. Forward! Do not fall behind, friends! Anya (strikes her hands together). How well you speak! (Pause.) It’s wonderful here today. Trofimov. Yes, the weather’s glorious. Anya. What have you done to me, Petya? Why don’t I love the cherry orchard as I used to? I loved it so tenderly. It seemed to me there was no spot on earth lovelier than our orchard. Trofimov. All Russia is our orchard. Our land is vast and beautiful, there are many wonderful places in it. (Pause.) Think of it, Anya, your grandfather, your great-grandfather and all your ancestors were serf owners, owners of living souls, and aren’t human beings looking at you from every tree in the orchard, from every leaf, from every trunk? Don’t you hear voices? Oh, it’s terrifying! Your orchard is a fearful place, and when you pass through it in the evening or at night, the old bark on the trees gleams faintly, and the cherry trees seem to be dreaming of things that happened a hundred, two hundred years ago and to be tormented by painful visions. What is there to say? We’re at least two hundred years behind, we’ve really achieved nothing yet, we have no definite attitude to the past, we only philosophize, complain of the blues, or drink vodka. It’s all so clear: in order to live in the present, we should first redeem our past, finish with it, and we can expiate it only by suffering, only by extraordinary, unceasing labor. Realize that, Anya. Anya. The house in which we live has long ceased to be our own, and I will leave it, I give you my word. Trofimov. If you have the keys, fling them into the well and go away. Be free as the wind. Anya (in ecstasy). How well you put that! Trofimov. Believe me, Anya, believe me! I’m not yet thirty, I’m young, I’m still a student—but I’ve already suffered so much. In winter I’m hungry, sick, harassed, poor as a beggar, and where hasn’t Fate driven me? Where haven’t I been? And yet always, every moment of the day and night, my soul is filled with inexplicable premonitions…. I have a premonition of happiness, Anya…. I see it already! Anya (pensively). The moon is rising. yepihodov is heard playing the same mournful tune on the guitar . The moon rises. Somewhere near the poplars varya is looking for anya and calling “Anya, where are you?” Trofimov. Yes, the moon is rising. (Pause.) There it is, happiness, it’s approaching, it’s coming nearer and nearer, I can already hear its footsteps. And if we don’t see it, if we don’t know it, what does it matter? Others will! Varya’s voice. “Anya! Where are you?” Trofimov. That Varya again! (Angrily.) It’s revolting! Anya. Never mind, let’s go down to the river. It’s lovely there. Trofimov. Come on. (They go.) Varya’s voice. “Anya! Anya!”
