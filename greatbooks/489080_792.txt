Work: Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania Field: proposals relating to the education of youth in pennsylvania Author: Benjamin Franklin Title: ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER It has long been regretted as a misfortune to the youth of this province that we have no academy in which they might receive the accomplishments of a regular education. The following paper of hints towards forming a plan for that purpose is so far approved by some public-spirited gentlemen, to whom it has been privately communicated, that they have directed a number of copies to be made by the press, and properly distributed, in order to obtain the sentiments and advice of men of learning, understanding, and experience in these matters; and have determined to use their interest and best endeavours to have the scheme, when completed, carried gradually into execution; in which they have reason to believe they shall have the hearty concurrence and assistance of many who are well-wishers to their country. Those who incline to favor the design with their advice, either as to the parts of learning to be taught, the order of study, the method of teaching, the economy of the school, or any other matter of importance to the success of the undertaking are desired to communicate their sentiments as soon as may be, by letter directed to B.Franklin, Printer, in Philadelphia.
