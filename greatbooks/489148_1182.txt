I feel it stealing now. Sentry, are you there? Just ease these darbies at the wrist, And roll me over fair! I am sleepy, and the oozy weeds about me twist.``` The foregoing text is from the definitive edition, billy budd, sailor (an inside narrative) , edited with notes by Harrison Hayford and M.M.Sealts, Jr., University of Chicago Press, © 1962 .
