Mr. Hovstad. Peter Stockmann (taking a paper from his pocket). It will be sufficient, for the guidance of the public, if this appears. It is an official statement. May I trouble you? Hovstad (taking the paper). Certainly; I will see that it is printed. Dr. Stockmann. But not mine. Do you imagine that you can silence me and stifle the truth! You will not find it so easy as you suppose. Mr. Aslaksen, kindly take my manuscript at once and print it as a pamphlet—at my expense. I will have four hundred copies—no, five—six hundred. Aslaksen. If you offered me its weight in gold, I could not lend my press for any such purpose, Doctor. It would be flying in the face of public opinion. You will not get it printed anywhere in the town. Dr. Stockmann. Then give it me back. Hovstad (giving him the manuscript). Here it is. Dr. Stockmann (taking his hat and stick). It shall be made public all the same. I will read it out at a mass meeting of the townspeople. All my fellow citizens shall hear the voice of truth! Peter Stockmann. You will not find any public body in the town that will give you the use of their hall for such a purpose. Aslaksen. Not a single one, I am certain. Billing. No, I’m damned if you will find one. Mrs. Stockmann. But this is too shameful! Why should every one turn against you like that? Dr. Stockmann (angrily). I will tell you why. It is because all the men in this town are old women—like you; they all think of nothing but their families, and never of the community. Mrs. Stockmann (putting her arm into his). Then I will show them that an—an old woman can be a man for once. I am going to stand by you, Thomas! Dr. Stockmann. Bravely said, Katherine! It shall be made public—as I am a living soul! If I can’t hire a hall, I shall hire a drum, and parade the town with it and read it at every street corner. Peter Stockmann. You are surely not such an arrant fool as that! Dr. Stockmann. Yes, I am. Aslaksen. You won’t find a single man in the whole town to go with you. Billing. No, I’m damned if you will. Mrs. Stockmann. Don’t give in, Thomas. I will tell the boys to go with you. Dr. Stockmann. That is a splendid idea! Mrs. Stockmann. Morten will be delighted; and Ejlif will do whatever he does. Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and Petra!—and you too, Katherine! Mrs. Stockmann. No, I won’t do that; but I will stand at the window and watch you, that’s what I will do. Dr. Stockmann (puts his arms round her and kisses her). Thank you, my dear! Now you and I are going to try a fall, my fine gentlemen! I am going to see whether a pack of cowards can succeed in gagging a patriot who wants to purify society! (He and his wife go out by the street door.) Peter Stockmann (shaking his head seriously). Now he has sent her out of her senses, too.
