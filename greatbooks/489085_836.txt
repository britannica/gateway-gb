However, many busybodies wouldn’t let the matter rest there and maintained that the ghost was still haunting certain distant parts of the city. And, sure enough, a watchman in the Kolomna district caught a glimpse of the ghost behind a house. But he was rather a frail watchman. (Once an ordinary, but mature, piglet, rushing out of a private house, knocked him off his feet to the huge delight of a bunch of cabbies, whom he fined two kopeks each for their lack of respect—then he spent the proceeds on tobacco.) So, being rather frail, the watchman didn’t dare to arrest the ghost. Instead he followed it in the darkness until at last it stopped suddenly, turned to face him, and asked: “You looking for trouble?” And it shook a huge fist at him, much larger than any you’ll find among the living. ‘“No,” the watchman said, turning away.
