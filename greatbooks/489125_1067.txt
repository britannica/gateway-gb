Cantor built. The theory of transfinites may still be so much nonsense to many mathematicians, but it is certainly consistent. The serious charge Henri Poincaré expressed in his aphorism, La logistique n’est plus stérile: elle engendre la contradiction [Logic is sterile no longer: it is engendering contradiction], has been successfully rebutted by the logistic doctrine so far as the infinite is concerned. To Cantor’s alephs then, we may ascribe the same existence as to the number 7. An existence statement free from self-contradiction may be made relative to either. For that matter, there is no valid reason to trust in the finite any more than in the infinite. It is as permissible to discard the infinite as it is to reject the impressions of one’s senses. It is neither more, nor less scientific to do so. In the final analysis, this is a matter of faith and taste, but not on a par with rejecting the belief in Santa Claus. Infinite classes, judged by finite standards, generate paradoxes much more absurd and a great deal less pleasing than the belief in Santa Claus; but when they are judged by the appropriate standards, they lose their odd appearance, behave as predictably as any finite integer. At last in its proper setting, the infinite has assumed a respectable place next to the finite, just as real and just as dependable, even though wholly different in character. Whatever the infinite may be, it is no longer a purple cow. The foregoing consists of Chapters I and II from Kasner and Newman’s mathematics and the imagination .
