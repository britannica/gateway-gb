Author: Sir Francis Bacon Francis Bacon was one of the first great enthusiasts of science. Science, in his view, not only could but should benefit the life of man. He explained and extolled scientific method. He pointed the way to the control of nature. He tried to convince his fellow men that they could understand how the world worked, and thereby live “like kings.” Men have always wanted to live like kings, and they listened to Bacon. The Sphinx is a fable. It is not always wise to say much about a fable. It should be read and pondered. There is much to think about in the following selection. Bacon himself draws many conclusions from his own fable. It could be left at that. But it is worth remarking that Bacon says that “of the Sphinx’s riddles there are in all two kinds: one concerning the nature of things, another concerning the nature of man.” When these words were written—the early seventeenth century—both kinds of riddles may have seemed equally soluble. But is there not evidence that the one kind is much more difficult than the other? As to “the nature of things,” we cannot help recognizing that much progress has been made in the 350 years since Bacon wrote. His wildest dreams have been realized, and more. Men live now as no king could have imagined living then. But as to “the nature of man,” how much does the modern age know which Bacon did not know? Or has it even forgotten some things that seemed clear and obvious to him? That is another question.
