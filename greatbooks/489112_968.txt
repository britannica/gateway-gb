There is a tremendous difference between poodle-men and cur-men. And the amusing part of it is, that Mr. Hovstad quite agrees with me as long as it is a question of four-footed animals— Hovstad. Yes, it is true enough as far as they are concerned. Dr. Stockmann. Very well. But as soon as I extend the principle and apply it to two-legged animals, Mr. Hovstad stops short. He no longer dares to think independently, or to pursue his ideas to their logical conclusion; so he turns the whole theory upside down and proclaims in the “People’s Messenger” that it is the barn-door hens and street curs that are the finest specimens in the menagerie. But that is always the way, as long as a man retains the traces of common origin and has not worked his way up to intellectual distinction. Hovstad. I lay no claim to any sort of distinction. I am the son of humble countryfolk, and I am proud that the stock I come from is rooted deep among the common people he insults! Voices. Bravo, Hovstad! Bravo! Bravo! Dr. Stockmann. The kind of common people I mean are not only to be found low down in the social scale; they crawl and swarm all around us—even in the highest social positions. You have only to look at your own fine, distinguished Mayor! My brother Peter is every bit as plebeian as anyone that walks in two shoes—(laughter and hisses). Peter Stockmann. I protest against personal allusions of this kind. Dr. Stockmann (imperturbably). —and that, not because he is, like myself, descended from some old rascal of a pirate from Pomerania or thereabouts—because that is who we are descended from— Peter Stockmann. An absurd legend. I deny it! Dr. Stockmann. —but because he thinks what his superiors think and holds the same opinions as they. People who do that are, intellectually speaking, common people; and that is why my magnificent brother Peter is in reality so very far from any distinction—and consequently also so far from being liberal-minded. Peter Stockmann. Mr. Chairman—! Hovstad. So it is only the distinguished men that are liberal-minded in this country? We are learning something quite new! (Laughter.) Dr. Stockmann. Yes, that is part of my new discovery too. And another part of it is that broad-mindedness is almost precisely the same thing as morality. That is why I maintain that it is absolutely inexcusable in the “People’s Messenger” to proclaim, day in and day out, the false doctrine that it is the masses, the crowd, the compact majority, that have the monopoly of broad-mindedness and morality—and that vice and corruption and every kind of intellectual depravity are the result of culture, just as all the filth that is draining into our Baths is the result of the tanneries up at Mölledal! (Uproar and interruptions. dr. stockmann is undisturbed, and goes on, carried away by his ardor, with a smile.) And yet this same “People’s Messenger” can go on preaching that the masses ought to be elevated to higher conditions of life! But, bless my soul, if the “Messenger’s” teaching is to be depended upon, this very raising up the masses would mean nothing more or less than setting them straightway upon the paths of depravity! Happily the theory that culture demoralizes is only an old falsehood that our forefathers believed in and we have inherited. No, it is ignorance, poverty, ugly conditions of life, that do the devil’s work! In a house which does not get aired and swept every day—my wife Katherine maintains that the floor ought to be scrubbed as well, but that is a debatable question—in such a house, let me tell you, people will lose within two or three years the power of thinking or acting in a moral manner. Lack of oxygen weakens the conscience. And there must be a plentiful lack of oxygen in very many houses in this town, I should think, judging from the fact that the whole compact majority can be unconscientious enough to wish to build the town’s prosperity on a quagmire of falsehood and deceit. Aslaksen. We cannot allow such a grave accusation to be flung at a citizen community. A Citizen. I move that the Chairman direct the speaker to sit down. Voices (angrily). Hear, hear! Quite right! Make him sit down! Dr. Stockmann (losing his self-control). Then I will go and shout the truth at every street corner! I will write it in other towns’ newspapers! The whole country shall know what is going on here! Hovstad. It almost seems as if Dr. Stockmann’s intention were to ruin the town. Dr. Stockmann. Yes, my native town is so dear to me that I would rather ruin it than see it flourishing upon a lie. Aslaksen. This is really serious. Uproar and catcalls. mrs. stockmann coughs, but to no purpose; her husband does not listen to her any longer . Hovstad (shouting above the din). A man must be a public enemy to wish to ruin a whole community! Dr. Stockmann (with growing fervor). What does the destruction of a community matter, if it lives on lies! It ought to be razed to the ground, I tell you! All who live by lies ought to be exterminated like vermin! You will end by infecting the whole country; you will bring about such a state of things that the whole country will deserve to be ruined. And if things come to that pass, I shall say from the bottom of my heart: Let the whole country perish, let all these people be exterminated! Voices from the crowd. That is talking like an out-and-out enemy of the people! Billing. There sounded the voice of the people, by all that’s holy! The whole crowd (shouting). Yes, yes! He is an enemy of the people! He hates his country! He hates his own people! Aslaksen. Both as a citizen and as an individual, I am profoundly disturbed by what we have had to listen to. Dr. Stockmann has shown himself in a light I should never have dreamed of. I am unhappily obliged to subscribe to the opinion which I have just heard my estimable fellow citizens utter; and I propose that we should give expression to that opinion in a resolution. I propose a resolution as follows: “This meeting declares that it considers Dr. Thomas Stockmann, Medical Officer of the Baths, to be an enemy of the people.” A storm of cheers and applause. A number of men surround the doctor and hiss him . mrs. stockmann and petra have got up from their seats . morten and ejlif are fighting the other schoolboys for hissing; some of their elders separate them . Dr. Stockmann (to the men who are hissing him). Oh, you fools! I tell you that— Aslaksen (ringing his bell). We cannot hear you now, Doctor. A formal vote is about to be taken; but, out of regard for personal feelings, it shall be by ballot and not verbal. Have you any clean paper, Mr. Billing? Billing. I have both blue and white here. Aslaksen (going to him). That will do nicely; we shall get on more quickly that way. Cut it up into small strips—yes, that’s it. (To the meeting.) Blue means no; white means yes. I will come round myself and collect votes. peter stockmann leaves the hall . aslaksen and one or two others go round the room with the slips of paper in their hats . 1st Citizen (to hovstad). I say, what has come to the Doctor? What are we to think of it? Hovstad. Oh, you know how headstrong he is. 2nd Citizen (to billing). Billing, you go to their house—have you ever noticed if the fellow drinks? Billing. Well, I’m hanged if I know what to say. There are always spirits on the table when you go. 3rd Citizen. I rather think he goes quite off his head sometimes. 1st Citizen. I wonder if there is any madness in his family? Billing. I shouldn’t wonder if there were. 4th Citizen. No, it is nothing more than sheer malice; he wants to get even with somebody for something or other. Billing. Well, certainly he suggested a rise in his salary on one occasion lately, and did not get it. The Citizens (together). Ah!—then it is easy to understand how it is! The Drunken Man (who has got amongst the audience again). I want a blue one, I do! And I want a white one too! Voices. It’s that drunken chap again! Turn him out! Morten Kiil (going up to dr. stockmann). Well, Stockmann, do you see what these monkey tricks of yours lead to? Dr. Stockmann. I have done my duty. Morten Kiil. What was that you said about the tanneries at Mölledal? Dr. Stockmann. You heard well enough. I said they were the source of all the filth. Morten Kiil. My tannery too? Dr. Stockmann. Unfortunately your tannery is by far the
