Mamma. Gayev. Well, really, everything is all right now. Before the cherry orchard was sold, we all fretted and suffered; but afterwards, when the question was settled finally and irrevocably, we all calmed down, and even felt quite cheerful. I’m a bank employee now, a financier. The yellow ball in the side pocket! And anyhow, you are looking better, Luba, there’s no doubt of that. Mme. Ranevskaya. Yes, my nerves are better, that’s true. (She is handed her hat and coat.) I sleep well. Carry out my things, Yasha. It’s time. (To anya.) We shall soon see each other again, my little girl. I’m going to Paris, I’ll live there on the money your great-aunt sent us to buy the estate with—long live Auntie! But that money won’t last long. Anya. You’ll come back soon, soon, Mamma, won’t you? Meanwhile I’ll study, I’ll pass my high school examination, and then I’ll go to work and help you. We’ll read all kinds of books together, Mamma, won’t we? (Kisses her mother’s hands.) We’ll read in the autumn evenings, we’ll read lots of books, and a new wonderful world will open up before us. (Falls into a reverie.) Mamma, do come back. Mme. Ranevskaya. I will come back, my precious. (Embraces her daugh ter. Enter lopahin and charlotta, who is humming softly.) Gayev. Charlotta’s happy: she’s singing. Charlotta (picks up a bundle and holds it like a baby in swaddling clothes). Bye, baby, bye. (A baby is heard crying “Wah! Wah!”) Hush, hush, my pet, my little one. “Wah! Wah!” I’m so sorry for you! (Throws the bundle down.) You will find me a position, won’t you? I can’t go on like this. Lopahin. We’ll find one for you, Charlotta Ivanovna, don’t worry. Gayev. Everyone’s leaving us. Varya’s going away. We’ve suddenly become of no use. Charlotta. There’s no place for me to live in town, I must go away. (Hums.) Enter pishchik . Lopahin. There’s nature’s masterpiece! Pishchik (gasping). Oh…let me get my breath…I’m in agony. …Esteemed friends…Give me a drink of water…. Gayev. Wants some money, I suppose. No, thank you…I’ll keep out of harm’s way. (Exits.) Pishchik. It’s a long while since I’ve been to see you, most charming lady. (To lopahin.) So you are here…glad to see you, you intellectual giant…There…(Gives lopahin money.) Here’s 400 rubles, and I still owe you 840. Lopahin (shrugging his shoulders in bewilderment). I must be dreaming…Where did you get it? Pishchik. Wait a minute…It’s hot…A most extraordinary event! Some Englishmen came to my place and found some sort of white clay on my land…(To mme. ranevskaya.) And 400 for you… most lovely…most wonderful…(Hands her the money.) The rest later. (Drinks water.) A young man in the train was telling me just now that a great philosopher recommends jumping off roofs. “Jump!” says he; “that’s the long and the short of it!” (In amaze ment.) Just imagine! Some more water! Lopahin. What Englishmen? Pishchik. I leased them the tract with the clay on it for twenty-four years…. And now, forgive me, I can’t stay…. I must be dashing on…. I’m going over to Znoikov…to Kardamanov…I owe them all money…(Drinks water.) Good-by, everybody…I’ll look in on Thursday…. Mme. Ranevskaya. We’re just moving into town; and tomorrow I go abroad. Pishchik (upset). What? Why into town? That’s why the furniture is like that . . . and the suitcases…Well, never mind! (Through tears.) Never mind…Men of colossal intellect, these Englishmen… Never mind…Be happy. God will come to your help…Never mind…Everything in this world comes to an end. (Kisses mme. ranevskaya’s hand.) If the rumor reaches you that it’s all up with me, remember this old…horse, and say: Once there lived a certain…Simeonov-Pishchik…the kingdom of Heaven be his …Glorious weather!…Yes…(Exits, in great confusion, but at once returns and says in the doorway) My daughter Dashenka sends her regards. (Exits.) Mme. Ranevskaya. Now we can go. I leave with two cares weighing on me. The first is poor old Firs. (Glancing at her watch.) We still have about five minutes. Anya. Mamma, Firs has already been taken to the hospital. Yasha sent him there this morning. Mme. Ranevskaya. My other worry is Varya. She’s used to getting up early and working; and now, with no work to do, she is like a fish out of water. She has grown thin and pale, and keeps crying, poor soul. (Pause.) You know this very well, Yermolay Alexeyevich; I dreamed of seeing her married to you, and it looked as though that’s how it would be. (Whispers to anya, who nods to charlotta and both go out.) She loves you. You find her attractive. I don’t know, I don’t know why it is you seem to avoid each other; I can’t understand it. Lopahin. To tell you the truth, I don’t understand it myself. It’s all a puzzle. If there’s still time, I’m ready now, at once. Let’s settle it straight off, and have done with it! Without you, I feel I’ll never be able to propose. Mme. Ranevskaya. That’s splendid. After all, it will only take a minute. I’ll call her at once…. Lopahin. And luckily, here’s champagne too. (Looks at the glasses.) Empty! Somebody’s drunk it all. (yasha coughs.) That’s what you might call guzzling… Mme. Ranevskaya (animatedly). Excellent! We’ll go and leave you alone. Yasha, allez! I’ll call her. (At the door.) Varya, leave everything and come here. Come! (Exits with yasha.) Lopahin (looking at his watch). Yes…(Pause behind the door, smothered laughter and whispering; at last, enter varya.) Varya (looking over the luggage in leisurely fashion). Strange, I can’t find it… Lopahin. What are you looking for? Varya. Packed it myself, and I don’t remember…(Pause.) Lopahin. Where are you going now, Varya? Varya. I? To the Ragulins’. I’ve arranged to take charge there—as housekeeper, if you like. Lopahin. At Yashnevo? About fifty miles from here. (Pause.) Well, life in this house is ended! Varya (examining luggage). Where is it? Perhaps I put it in the chest. Yes, life in this house is ended…There will be no more of it. Lopahin. And I’m just off to Kharkov—by this next train. I’ve a lot to do there. I’m leaving Yepihodov here…I’ve taken him on. Varya. Oh! Lopahin. Last year at this time it was snowing, if you remember, but now it’s sunny and there’s no wind. It’s cold, though…It must be three below. Varya. I didn’t look. (Pause.) And besides, our thermometer’s broken. (Pause. Voice from the yard: “Yermolay Alexeyevich!”) Lopahin (as if he had been waiting for the call). This minute! (Exits quickly. varya sits on the floor and sobs quietly, her head on a bundle of clothes. Enter mme. ranevskaya cautiously.) Mme. Ranevskaya. Well? (Pause.) We must be going. Varya (wiping her eyes). Yes, it’s time, Mamma dear. I’ll be able to get to the Ragulins’ today, if only we don’t miss the train. Mme. Ranevskaya (at the door). Anya, put your things on. (Enter anya, gayev, charlotta. gayev wears a heavy overcoat with a hood. Enter servants and coachmen. yepihodov bustles about the luggage.) Mme. Ranevskaya. Now we can start on our journey. Anya (joyfully). On our journey! Gayev. My friends, my dear, cherished friends, leaving this house forever, can I be silent? Can I at leave-taking refrain from giving utterance to those emotions that now fill my being? Anya (imploringly). Uncle! Varya. Uncle, Uncle dear, don’t. Gayev (forlornly). I’ll bank the yellow in the side pocket…I’ll be silent… Enter trofimov , then lopahin . Trofimov. Well, ladies and gentlemen, it’s time to leave. Lopahin. Yepihodov, my coat. Mme. Ranevskaya. I’ll sit down just a minute. It seems as though I’d never before seen what the walls of this house were like, the ceilings, and now I look at them hungrily, with such tender affection. Gayev. I remember when I was six years old sitting on that window sill on Whitsunday, watching my father going to church. Mme. Ranevskaya. Has everything been taken? Lopahin. I think so. (Putting on his overcoat.) Yepihodov, see that everything’s in order. Yepihodov (in a husky voice). You needn’t worry, Yermolay Alexeyevich. Lopahin. What’s the matter with your voice? Yepihodov. I just had a drink of water. I must have swallowed something. Yasha (contemptuously). What ignorance! Mme. Ranevskaya. When we’re gone, not a soul will be left here. Lopahin. Until the spring. varya pulls an umbrella out of a bundle, as though about to hit someone with it . lopahin pretends to be frightened . Varya. Come, come, I had no such idea! Trofimov. Ladies and gentlemen, let’s get into the carriages—it’s time. The train will be in directly. Varya. Petya, there they are, your rubbers, by that trunk. (Tearfully) And what dirty old things they are! Trofimov (puts on rubbers). Let’s go, ladies and gentlemen. Gayev (greatly upset, afraid of breaking down). The train…the station…Three cushions in the side pocket, I’ll bank this one in the corner… Mme. Ranevskaya. Let’s go. Lopahin. Are we all here? No one in
