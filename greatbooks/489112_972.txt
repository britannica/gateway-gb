at my attack on you and your wise friends. Peter Stockmann (starts and looks intently at him). Ah, that throws a light on various things. Dr. Stockmann. What things? Peter Stockmann. I see that the whole thing was a combined maneuver on your part and his. These violent, reckless attacks that you have made against the leading men of the town, under the pretense that it was in the name of truth— Dr. Stockmann. What about them? Peter Stockmann. I see that they were nothing else than the stipulated price for that vindictive old man’s will. Dr. Stockmann (almost speechless). Peter—you are the most disgusting plebeian I have ever met in all my life. Peter Stockmann. All is over between us. Your dismissal is irrevocable—we have a weapon against you now. (Goes out.) Dr. Stockmann. For shame! For shame! (Calls out.) Katherine, you must have the floor scrubbed after him! Let—what’s her name—devil take it, the girl who has always got soot on her nose— Mrs. Stockmann (in the sitting room). Hush, Thomas, be quiet! Petra (coming to the door). Father, grandfather is here, asking if he may speak to you alone. Dr. Stockmann. Certainly he may. (Going to the door.) Come in, Mr. Kiil. (morten kiil comes in. dr. stockmann shuts the door after him.) What can I do for you? Won’t you sit down? Morten Kiil. I won’t sit. (Looks around.) You look very comfortable here today, Thomas. Dr. Stockmann. Yes, don’t we! Morten Kiil. Very comfortable—plenty of fresh air. I should think you have got enough today of that oxygen you were talking about yesterday. Your conscience must be in splendid order today, I should think. Dr. Stockmann. It is. Morten Kiil. So I should think. (Taps his chest.) Do you know what I have got here? Dr. Stockmann. A good conscience, too, I hope. Morten Kiil. Bah! No, it is something better than that. (He takes a thick pocketbook from his breast pocket, opens it and displays a packet of papers.) Dr. Stockmann (looking at him in astonishment). Shares in the Baths? Morten Kiil. They were not difficult to get today. Dr. Stockmann. And you have been buying—? Morten Kiil. As many as I could pay for. Dr. Stockmann. But, my dear Mr. Kiil—consider the state of the Baths’ affairs! Morten Kiil. If you behave like a reasonable man, you can soon set the Baths on their feet again. Dr. Stockmann. Well, you can see for yourself that I have done all I can, but—. They are all mad in this town! Morten Kiil. You said yesterday that the worst of this pollution came from my tannery. If that is true, then my grandfather and my father before me, and I myself, for many years past, have been poisoning the town like three destroying angels. Do you think I am going to sit quiet under that reproach? Dr. Stockmann. Unfortunately I am afraid you will have to. Morten Kiil. No, thank you. I am jealous of my name and reputation. They call me “the Badger,” I am told. A badger is a kind of pig, I believe; but I am not going to give them the right to call me that. I mean to live and die a clean man. Dr. Stockmann. And how are you going to set about it? Morten Kiil. You shall cleanse me, Thomas. Dr. Stockmann. I! Morten Kiil. Do you know what money I have bought these shares with? No, of course you can’t know—but I will tell you. It is the money that Katherine and Petra and the boys will have when I am gone. Because I have been able to save a little bit after all, you know. Dr. Stockmann (flaring up). And you have gone and taken Katherine’s money for this! Morten Kiil. Yes, the whole of the money is invested in the Baths now. And now I just want to see whether you are quite stark, staring mad, Thomas! If you still make out that these animals and other nasty things of that sort come from my tannery, it will be exactly as if you were to flay broad strips of skin from Katherine’s body, and Petra’s, and the boys’; and no decent man would do that—unless he were mad. Dr. Stockmann (walking up and down). Yes, but I am mad; I am mad! Morten Kiil. You cannot be so absurdly mad as all that, when it is a question of your wife and children. Dr. Stockmann (standing still in front of him). Why couldn’t you consult me about it, before you went and bought all that trash? Morten Kiil. What is done cannot be undone. Dr. Stockmann (walks about uneasily). If only I were not so certain about it—! But I am absolutely convinced that I am right. Morten Kiil (weighing the pocketbook in his hand). If you stick to your mad idea, this won’t be worth much, you know. (Puts the pocketbook in his pocket.) Dr. Stockmann. But, hang it all! it might be possible for science to discover some prophylactic, I should think—or some antidote of some kind— Morten Kiil. To kill these animals, do you mean? Dr. Stockmann. Yes, or to make them innocuous. Morten Kiil. Couldn’t you try some ratsbane? Dr. Stockmann. Don’t talk nonsense! They all say it is only imagination, you know. Well, let it go at that! Let them have their own way about it! Haven’t the ignorant, narrow-minded curs reviled me as an enemy of the people?—and haven’t they been ready to tear the clothes off my back too? Morten Kiil. And broken all your windows to pieces! Dr. Stockmann. And then there is my duty to my family. I must talk it over with Katherine; she is great on those things. Morten Kiil. That is right; be guided by a reasonable woman’s advice. Dr. Stockmann (advancing towards him). To think you could do such a preposterous thing! Risking Katherine’s money in this way, and putting me in such a horribly painful dilemma! When I look at you, I think I see the devil himself—. Morten Kiil. Then I had better go. But I must have an answer from you before two o’clock—yes or no. If it is no, the shares go to a charity, and that this very day. Dr. Stockmann. And what does Katherine get? Morten Kiil. Not a halfpenny. (The door leading to the hall opens and hovstad and aslaksen make their appearance.) Look at those two! Dr. Stockmann (staring at them). What the devil!—have you actually the face to come into my house? Hovstad. Certainly. Aslaksen. We have something to say to you, you see. Morten Kiil (in a whisper). Yes or no—before two o’clock. Aslaksen (glancing at hovstad). Aha! (morten kiil goes out.) Dr. Stockmann. Well, what do you want with me? Be brief. Hovstad. I can quite understand that you are annoyed with us for our attitude at the meeting yesterday— Dr. Stockmann. Attitude, do you call it? Yes, it was a charming attitude! I call it weak, womanish—damnably shameful! Hovstad. Call it what you like, we could not do otherwise. Dr. Stockmann. You dared not do otherwise—isn’t that it? Hovstad. Well, if you like to put it that way. Aslaksen. But why did you not let us have word of it beforehand?—just a hint to Mr. Hovstad or to me? Dr. Stockmann. A hint? Of what? Aslaksen. Of what was behind it all. Dr. Stockmann. I don’t understand you in the least. Aslaksen (with a confidential nod). Oh yes, you do, Dr. Stockmann. Hovstad. It is no good making a mystery of it any longer. Dr. Stockmann (looking first at one of them and then at the other). What the devil do you both mean? Aslaksen. May I ask if your father-in-law is not going round the town buying up all the shares in the Baths? Dr. Stockmann. Yes, he has been buying Bath shares today; but— Aslaksen. It would have been more prudent to get some one else to do it—some one less nearly related to you. Hovstad. And you should not have let your name appear in the affair. There was no need for anyone to know that the attack on the Baths came from you. You ought to have consulted me, Dr. Stockmann. Dr. Stockmann (looks in front of him; then a light seems to dawn on him and he says in amazement): Are such things conceivable? Are such things possible? Aslaksen (with a smile). Evidently they are. But it is better to use a little finesse, you know. Hovstad. And it is much better to have several persons in a thing of that sort; because the responsibility of each individual is lessened, when there are others with him. Dr. Stockmann (composedly). Come to the point, gentlemen. What do you want? Aslaksen. Perhaps Mr. Hovstad had better— Hovstad. No, you tell him, Aslaksen. Aslaksen. Well, the fact is that, now we know the bearings of the whole affair,
