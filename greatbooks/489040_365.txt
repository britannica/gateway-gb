Work: What Is War? Field: what is war Author: Karl von Clausewitz Title: HERE, THEREFORE, A PRINCIPLE OF POLARITY IS BROUGHT INTO EVIDENCE By supposing the interests of the one commander to be always diametrically opposed to those of the other, we have assumed a true polarity. We propose later on to devote a special chapter to this principle, but for the present must make one observation upon it. The principle of polarity only holds good if it is conceived in one and the same thing, in which the positive and its opposite, the negative, exactly destroy one another. In a battle each of the two parties wishes to win; that is true polarity, for the victory of the one destroys that of the other. But if we are speaking of two different things which have a common relation external to themselves, it is not the things but their relations that have the polarity.
