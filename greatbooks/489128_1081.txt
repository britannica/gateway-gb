Work: Characters Field: characters Author: La Bruyère Title: PHÉDON Phédon has hollow eyes, a bilious complexion, a dry body and a thin face; he sleeps little and his slumber is very light; he is abstracted, dreamy and with all his wit seems stupid; he forgets to say what he knows or to speak of events which are known to him; and if he does so sometimes he comes out badly, he thinks he is a nuisance to those he speaks to, he relates things briefly but frigidly; he is not listened to, he does not stir laughter. He applauds, he smiles at what others say to him, he is of their opinion; he runs, he flies to render them little services. He is complaisant, flattering, eager, he is mysterious about his own affairs, sometimes a liar; he is superstitious, scrupulous, timid. He walks gently and lightly, he seems afraid to touch the ground; he walks with lowered eyes and dares not raise them to the passers-by. He is never among those who form a circle for discussion; he places himself behind the person who is speaking, furtively gathers what he says and goes away if he is looked at. He occupies no space, claims no place; he walks with hunched shoulders, his hat pulled over his eyes so as not to be seen; he shrinks and hides himself in his cloak; there are no streets or galleries so overcrowded and filled with people but that he finds a means of traversing them easily, of slipping through them without being noticed. If he is asked to sit down, he places himself just on the edge of the chair; he speaks in a low tone in conversation and articulates badly; yet with his friends he is open about public affairs, bitter against the age, very little disposed in favour of the ministers of state and the government. He never opens his mouth except to reply; he coughs and blows his nose behind his hat; he spits almost on himself, and he waits until he is alone to sneeze, or if it happens to him it is unperceived by the company present: he costs nobody a salute or a compliment. He is poor.
