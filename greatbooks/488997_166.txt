suit every one, even among doctors, but since St. Thomas rested on this simple assertion, it is no concern of ours to argue the theology. Only as art, one can afford to say that the form is more architectural than religious; it would surely have been suspicious to St. Bernard. Mystery there was none, and logic little. The concept of the Holy Ghost was childlike; for a pupil of Aristotle it was inadmissible, since it led to nothing and helped no step toward the universe. Admitting, if necessary, the criticism, Thomas need not admit the blame, if blame there were. Every theologian was obliged to stop the pursuit of logic by force, before it dragged him into paganism and pantheism. Theology begins with the universal—God—who must be a reality, not a symbol; but it is forced to limit the process of God’s realizations somewhere, or the priest soon becomes a worshiper of God in sticks and stones. Theologists had commonly chosen, from time immemorial, to stop at the Trinity; within the triangle they were wholly realist; but they could not admit that God went on to realize Himself in the square and circle, or that the third member of the Trinity contained multiplicity, because the Trinity was a restless weight on the Church piers, which, like the central tower, constantly tended to fall, and needed to be lightened. Thomas gave it the lightest form possible, and there fixed it. Then came his great tour de force, the vaulting of his broad nave; and, if ignorance is allowed an opinion, even a lost soul may admire the grand simplicity of Thomas’ scheme. He swept away the horizontal lines altogether, leaving them barely as a part of decoration. The whole weight of his arches fell, as in the latest Gothic, where the eye sees nothing to break the sheer spring of the nervures, from the rosette on the keystone a hundred feet above down to the church floor. In Thomas’ creation nothing intervened between God and his world; secondary causes became ornaments; only two forces, God and man, stood in the Church. The chapter of Creation is so serious, and Thomas’ creation, like every other, is open to so much debate, that no student can allow another to explain it; and certainly no man whatever, either saint or skeptic, can ever yet have understood Creation aright unless divinely inspired; but whatever Thomas’ theory was as he meant it, he seems to be understood as holding that every created individual—animal, vegetable, or mineral—was a special, divine act. Whatever has form is created, and whatever is created takes form directly from the will of God, which is also his act. The intermediate universals—the secondary causes—vanish as causes; they are, at most, sequences or relations; all merge in one universal act of will; instantaneous, infinite, eternal. St. Thomas saw God, much as Milton saw him, resplendent in Poem ```That glorious form, that light unsufferable, And that far-beaming blaze of Majesty, Wherewith he wont, at Heaven’s high council table, To sit the midst of Trinal Unity;``` except that, in Thomas’ thought, the council table was a worktable, because God did not take counsel; He was an act. The Trinity was an infinite possibility of will; nothing within but Poem ```The baby image of the giant mass Of things to come at large.``` Neither time nor space, neither matter nor mind, not even force existed, nor could any intelligence conceive how, even though they should exist, they could be united in the lowest association. A crystal was as miraculous as Socrates. Only abstract force, or what the schoolmen called form, existed undeveloped from eternity, like the abstract line in mathematics. Fifty or a hundred years before St. Thomas settled the Church dogma, a monk of Citeaux or some other abbey, a certain Alain of Lille, had written a Latin poem, as abstruse an allegory as the best, which had the merit of painting the scene of man’s creation as far as concerned the mechanical process much as Thomas seems to have seen it. M.Hauréau has printed an extract. Alain conceded to the weakness of human thought, that God was working in time and space, or rather on His throne in heaven, when Nature, proposing to create a new and improved man, sent Reason and Prudence up to ask Him for a soul to fit the new body. Having passed through various adventures and much scholastic instruction, the messenger Prudence arrived, after having dropped her dangerous friend Reason by the way. The request was respectfully presented to God, and favorably received. God promised the soul, and at once sent His servant Noys—Thought—to the storehouse of ideas, to choose it:Ipse Deus rem prosequitur, producit in actum|God Himself pursues the task, and sets in act Quod pepigit. Vocat ergo Noym quae praepaert illi|What He promised. So he calls Noys to seek Numinis exemplar, humanae mentis Idaeam,|A copy of His will, Idea of the human mind, Ad cujus formam formetur spiritus omni|To whose form the spirit should be shaped, Munere virtutum dives, qui, nube caducae|Rich in every virtue, which, veiled in garb Carnis odumbratus veletur corporis umbra.|Of frail flesh, is to be hidden in a shade of body, Tunc Noys ad regis praeceptum singula rerum|Then Noys, at the King’s order, turning one by one Vestigans exempla, novam perquirit Idaeam.|Each sample, seeks the new Idea. Inter tot species, speciem vix invenit illam|Among so many images she hardly finds that Quam petit; offertur tandem quaesita petenti.|Which she seeks; at last the sought one appears. Hanc formam Noys ipsa Deo prae sentat ut ejus|This form Noys herself brings to God for Him Formet ad exemplar animam. Tunc ille sigillum|To form a soul to its pattern. He takes the seal, Sumit, ad ipsius formae vestigia formam|And gives form to the soul after the model Dans animae, vultum qualem de poscit Idaea|Of the form itself, stamping on the sample Imprimit exemplo; totas usurpat imago|The figure such as the Idea requires. The seal Exemplaris opes, loquiturque figura sigillum.|Covers the whole field, and the impression expresses the stamp. The translation is probably full of mistakes; indeed, one is permitted to doubt whether Alain himself accurately understood the process; but in substance he meant that God contained a storehouse of ideas, and stamped each creation with one of these forms. The poets used a variety of figures to help out their logic, but that of the potter and his pot was one of the most common. Omar Khayyam was using it at the same time with Alain of Lille, but with a difference: for his pot seems to have been matter alone, and his soul was the wine it received from God; while Alain’s soul seems to have been the form and not the contents of the pot. The figure matters little. In any case God’s act was the union of mind with matter by the same act or will which created both. No intermediate cause or condition intervened; no secondary influence had anything whatever to do with the result. Time had nothing to do with it. Every individual that has existed or shall exist was created by the same instantaneous act, for all time. “When the question regards the universal agent who produces beings and time, we cannot consider him as acting now and before, according to the succession of time.” God emanated time, force, matter, mind, as He might emanate gravitation, not as a part of His substance but as an energy of His will, and maintains them in their activity by the same act, not by a new one. Every individual is a part of the direct act; not a secondary outcome. The soul has no father or mother. Of all errors one of the most serious is to suppose that the soul descends by generation. “Having life and action of its own, it subsists without the body;…it must therefore be produced directly, and since it is not a material substance, it cannot be produced by way of generation; it must necessarily be created by God. Consequently to suppose that the intelligence [or intelligent soul] is the effect of generation is to suppose that it is not a pure and simple substance but corruptible like the body. It is therefore heresy to say that this soul is transmitted by generation.” What is true of the soul should be true of all other form, since no form is a material substance. The utmost possible relation between any two individuals is that God may have used the same stamp or mold for a series of creations, and especially for the less spiritual: “God is the first model for all things. One may also say that, among His creatures some serve as types or models for others because there are some which are made in the image of others”; but generation means sequence, not cause. The only true cause is God. Creation is His sole act, in which no second cause can share. “Creation is more perfect and loftier
