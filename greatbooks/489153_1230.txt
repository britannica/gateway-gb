manner. Du Bois. Sir, a fellow with a black dress and phiz came quite into the kitchen, to leave with us a paper scribbled after such a manner that a man had need be more cunning than the devil to read it. I make no manner o’ doubt, but ’tis about your lawsuit; but Beelzebub himself, I believe, could not find it out. Alcestes. Well! How! What does this paper discover, traitor, with respect to our departure you spoke of just now? Du Bois. ’Tis to tell you, sir, as how an hour afterwards, a man who comes often to visit you came very earnestly to see for you, and not finding you, charged me softly, knowing that I am a very faithful servant, to tell you—stay, what d’ye call his name? Alcestes. Ha’ done with his name, rascal, and tell me what he said to thee. Du Bois. In short, ’tis one of your friends, and that’s sufficient. He told me that ’tis at your peril not to go hence, and that fortune threatens you here with being arrested. Alcestes. But how? Would he not specify anything t’ye? Du Bois. No, he asked me for a pen, ink, and paper; and wrote a word or two, by which, I believe, you may come at the knowledge of the bottom of this mystery. Alcestes. Give it me then. Célimène. What can there be in this? Alcestes. I don’t know, but I long to be fully let into it. Wilt thou ha’ done quickly, thou impertinent villain? Du Bois (after having fumbled for it a long while). Troth, sir, I left it upon your table. Alcestes. I don’t know what hinders me— Célimène. Don’t put yourself in a passion, but go and unravel this perplexing business. Alcestes. It seems to me that fortune, take what care I can, has sworn to debar me of your conversation; but to triumph over it, indulge my passion, madam, with one sight of you more before the day is ended.
