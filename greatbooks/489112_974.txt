Dr. Stockmann (snapping his fingers and getting up from the table). I have it! I have it, by Jove! You shall never set foot in the school again! The Boys. No more school! Mrs. Stockmann. But, Thomas— Dr. Stockmann. Never, I say. I will educate you myself; that is to say, you shan’t learn a blessed thing— Morten. Hooray! Dr. Stockmann. —but I will make liberal-minded and high-minded men of you. You must help me with that, Petra. Petra. Yes, father, you may be sure I will. Dr. Stockmann. And my school shall be in the room where they insulted me and called me an enemy of the people. But we are too few as we are; I must have at least twelve boys to begin with. Mrs. Stockmann.

That’s capital! Bring me some specimens of them. I am going to experiment with curs, just for once; there may be some exceptional heads among them. Morten.

Mrs. Stockmann. The strongest—now? Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and I will go so far as to say that now I am the strongest man in the whole world. Morten. I say! Dr. Stockmann (lowering his voice). Hush! You mustn’t say anything about it yet; but I have made a great discovery. Mrs. Stockmann. Another one? Dr. Stockmann. Yes. (Gathers them round him, and says confidentially): It is this, let me tell you—that the strongest man in the world is he who stands most alone. Mrs. Stockmann (smiling and shaking her head). Oh, Thomas, Thomas! Petra (encouragingly, as she grasps her father’s hands). Father!
