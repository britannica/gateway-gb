Work: The Doctor in Spite of Himself Field: doctor in spite of himself Author: Molière Title: ACT I Title: SCENE I Sganarel. No, I tell thee that I will not do’t, and that it belongs to me to talk, and to be master. Martina. And I tell thee that I’ll have thee to live as I please, and that I’m not married to thee to endure thy frolics. Sganarel. O the monstrous plague of having a wife! How right was Aristotle when he declared that a wife is worse than a devil! Martina. Observe a little the notable man, with his blockhead of an Aristotle. Sganarel. Yes, notable man. Find me a faggot-binder, who understands, like me, to reason upon things, who has served for six years a famous physician; and who in his younger days had his accidence by heart. Martina. Plague on thee for an eternal ass. Sganarel. Plague on thee for an impudent baggage. Martina. Cursed be that day and hour wherein I took it into my head to say Yes! Sganarel. Cursed be the hornified notary who made me sign to my ruin! Martina. It well becomes you, truly, to complain of that affair. Oughtest thou to be one single moment without thanking Heaven that thou hast me for thy wife? Or didst thou merit such a person as I am? Sganarel. ’Tis true that you did me too much honour, and I had room to be satisfied the first night of our nuptials. Hey—s’death, don’t make me speak upon that head; I should say certain things— Martina. What? what would you say? Sganarel. Enough; let us leave this chapter, it sufficeth that we know what we know, and that you were very lucky in lighting on me. Martina. Lucky d’ye call me in lighting on thee? A fellow who has brought me to a hospital, a sot, a rascal who eats up all that I have. Sganarel. You lie, I drink part of it. Martina. Who sells, piece by piece, everything that’s in the house. Sganarel. That’s living upon one’s means. Martina. Who has taken my very bed from under me. Sganarel. You’ll rise the earlier. Martina. Who, in short, has not left a single movable in all the house. Sganarel. We may move the easier. Martina. And who from morning to night does nothing but play and drink. Sganarel. That’s to keep myself from the vapours. Martina. And what would you have me do the while with my family? Sganarel. Whatever you please. Martina. I have four poor little infants in arms. Sganarel. Lay ’em on the ground. Martina. Who are crying to me every moment for bread. Sganarel. Give them the rod. When I have drunk well, and eaten well, I’ll have every one satisfied in my house. Martina. And do you mean, Sot, that things shall always go so? Sganarel. Wife, let us proceed softly, if you please. Martina. That I shall perpetually endure your insolences and debaucheries. Sganarel. Don’t let us put ourselves in a passion, Wife. Martina. And that I shall never be able to find a way of bringing you to your duty. Sganarel. You know, Wife, that I have not a very passive spirit of my own, and that I have an arm sufficiently strong. Martina. I laugh at your threats. Sganarel. My pretty little wife, my honey, your hide itches according to custom. Martina. I’ll let you see that I’m no ways afraid of you. Sganarel. My dear rib, you have a desire to force something from me. Martina. D’ye think that I fear your words? Sganarel. Sweet object of my vows, I shall cuff your ears. Martina. Sot, as thou art! Sganarel. I shall bang you. Martina. Wine-sack! Sganarel. I shall belabour you. Martina. Scoundrel! Sganarel. I shall curry you. Martina. Rascal, impudence, knave, coward, villain, hang-dog, mumper, rogue, pickpocket, varlet, thief— Sganarel. Um—you will have it then? (sganarel taking a cudgel and beating her.) Martina (crying). Oh! oh! oh! oh! Sganarel. This is the true method to make you quiet. Title: SCENE II Mr. Robert. Hoity, hoity, hoity; fie, what’s here to do? What a base trick is this! Plague on the scoundrel for beating his wife thus. Martina (to mr. robert). I have a mind that he should beat me. Mr. Robert. Nay then I agree to it with all my heart. Martina. What do you meddle for? Mr. Robert. I was in the wrong. Martina. Is it your business? Mr. Robert. You say right. Martina. Observe this impertinent mortal a little, who would hinder husbands from beating their wives! Mr. Robert. I recant. Martina. What have you to do to pry into it? Mr. Robert. Nothing. Martina. Does it belong to you to run your nose into it? Mr. Robert. No. Martina. Concern yourself with your own business. Mr. Robert. I say no more. Martina. I have a mind to be beaten. Mr. Robert. Agreed. Martina. ’Tisn’t at your expense. Mr. Robert. True. Martina. And you are a sot to come thrusting in your oar where you have nothing to do. (Gives him a blow.) Mr. Robert (to sganarel). Neighbour, I ask your pardon with all my heart. Go on, thrash, bang your wife as you should; I’ll help you if you will. Sganarel. I have not a mind to’t. Mr. Robert. Nay, that’s another thing. Sganarel. I will beat her if I will; and if I won’t, I won’t beat her. Mr. Robert. Mighty well. Sganarel. ’Tis my wife, and not yours. Mr. Robert. Undoubtedly. Sganarel. You have no business to command me. Mr. Robert. Right. Sganarel. I have nothing to do with your help. Mr. Robert. With all my heart. Sganarel. And you are an impertinent fellow to intrude into other people’s affairs. Learn what Cicero says, That between the tree and the finger you must not thrust in the bark. (Beats mr. robert, and drives him off.) Title: SCENE III Sganarel. So, come, let us be at peace with one another. Here, shake hands. Martina. Yes, after you have beat me in this manner? Sganarel. That’s nothing. Shake hands. Martina. I won’t. Sganarel. Hey! Martina. No. Sganarel. Sweet wife. Martina. No. Sganarel. Come, I tell thee. Martina. I won’t do’t. Sganarel. Come, come, come. Martina. No, I’ll be in a passion. Sganarel. Fie, ’tis a trifle. Come, come. Martina. Let me alone. Sganarel. Shake hands, I say. Martina. You have used me too ill. Sganarel. Well, go, I ask your pardon, let’s see thy hand. Martina. I forgive thee. (Aside.) But thou shalt pay for’t. Sganarel. You are a fool to regard that; these are trifling things, which are often necessary in friendship, and five or six strokes of a cudgel amongst people who love one another only serve to whet the affection. Go, I’ll be gone to the wood, and I promise thee above a hundred faggots to-day. Title: SCENE IV Martina (alone). Get thee gone, whatever face I put on’t, I shall not forget my resentment, and I’m all on fire to find means of punishing thee for the blows thou hast given me. I know well enough that a woman has always about her wherewith to be revenged of a husband. But that’s too delicate a punishment for my hang-dog. I want a revenge that he would feel a little better; for this is not sufficient for the injury I’ve received. Title: SCENE V Lucas (to valere, not seeing martina). I’facks we have taken the deuce of a commission on us, and I don’t know, for my part, what we think we could think of getting by’t. Valere (to lucas , not seeing martina ). What wouldst thou have, my honest man-nurse? We must obey our master; besides, we have both of us an interest in the health of our mistress his daughter, for her marriage, which is delayed by her disease, would without doubt bring us in a reward. Horatio, who is a generous man, has the best pretension to her person; and though she has discovered a kindness for one Leander, you know well enough that her father would never consent to receive him for his son-in-law. Martina (musing aside, thinking she’s alone). Can’t I find out some device to revenge myself? Lucas (to valere ). But what an a whim is this that’s gotten into his head, since the doctors have all lost their Latin in the affair? Valere (to lucas ). One sometimes finds by dint of searching what could not be found at first; and very often in simple places— Martina. Yes, I must be revenged at any rate whatever; these strokes of the cudgel rise in my stomach, I can’t digest them, and—(Running against valere and lucas .) Oh! Gentlemen, I ask your pardon, I did not see you, for I was puzzling my brains for something that perplexes me. Valere. Every one has their cares in this world. And we are likewise looking for what we gladly would find. Martina.
