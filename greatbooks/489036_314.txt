Anya. Well, tell me—have you paid the interest? Varya. How could we? Anya. Good heavens, good heavens! Varya. In August the estate will be put up for sale. Anya. My God! lopahin peeps in at the door and bleats . Lopahin. Meh-h-h. (Disappears.) Varya (through tears). What I couldn’t do to him! (Shakes her fist threat eningly.) Anya (embracing varya, gently). Varya, has he proposed to you? (varya shakes her head.) But he loves you. Why don’t you come to an understanding? What are you waiting for? Varya. Oh, I don’t think anything will ever come of it. He’s too busy, he has no time for me…pays no attention to me. I’ve washed my hands of him—I can’t bear the sight of him. They all talk about our getting married, they all congratulate me—and all the time there’s really nothing to it—it’s all like a dream. (In another tone.) You have a new brooch—like a bee. Anya (sadly). Mamma bought it. (She goes into her own room and speaks gaily like a child.) And you know, in Paris I went up in a balloon. Varya. My darling’s home, my pretty one is back! (dunyasha returns with the coffeepot and prepares coffee. varya stands at the door of anya’s room.) All day long, darling, as I go about the house, I keep dreaming. If only we could marry you off to a rich man, I should feel at ease. Then I would go into a convent, and afterwards to Kiev, to Moscow…I would spend my life going from one holy place to another…I’d go on and on…What a blessing that would be! Anya. The birds are singing in the orchard. What time is it? Varya. It must be after two. Time you were asleep, darling. (Goes into anya’s room.) What a blessing that would be! yasha enters with a plaid and a traveling bag, crosses the stage . Yasha (finically). May I pass this way, please? Dunyasha. A person could hardly recognize you, Yasha. Your stay abroad has certainly done wonders for you. Yasha. Hm-m…and who are you? Dunyasha. When you went away I was that high—(Indicating with her hand.) I’m Dunyasha—Fyodor Kozoyedev’s daughter. Don’t you remember? Yasha. Hm! What a peach! (He looks round and embraces her. She cries out and drops a saucer. yasha leaves quickly.) Varya (in the doorway, in a tone of annoyance). What’s going on here? Dunyasha (through tears). I’ve broken a saucer. Varya. Well, that’s good luck. Anya (coming out of her room). We ought to warn Mamma that Petya’s here. Varya. I left orders not to wake him. Anya (musingly). Six years ago father died. A month later brother Grisha was drowned in the river…. Such a pretty little boy he was—only seven. It was more than Mamma could bear, so she went away, went away without looking back…(Shudders.) How well I understand her, if she only knew! (Pauses.) And Petya Trofimov was Grisha’s tutor, he may remind her of it all… Enter firs , wearing a jacket and a white waistcoat . He goes up to the coffeepot. Firs (anxiously). The mistress will have her coffee here. (Puts on white gloves.) Is the coffee ready? (Sternly, to dunyasha.) Here, you! And where’s the cream? Dunyasha. Oh, my God! (Exits quickly.) Firs (fussing over the coffeepot). Hah! the addlehead! (Mutters to him self.) Home from Paris. And the old master used to go to Paris too…by carriage. (Laughs.) Varya. What is it, Firs? Firs. What is your pleasure, Miss? (Joyfully.) My mistress has come home, and I’ve seen her at last! Now I can die. (Weeps with joy.) Enter mme . ranevskaya , gayev , and simeonov-pishchik . The latter is wearing a tight-waisted, pleated coat of fine cloth, and full trousers. gayev , as he comes in, goes through the motions of a billiard player with his arms and body . Mme. Ranevskaya. Let’s see, how does it go? Yellow ball in the corner! Bank shot in the side pocket! Gayev. I’ll tip it in the corner! There was a time, sister, when you and I used to sleep in this very room, and now I’m fifty-one, strange as it may seem. Lopahin. Yes, time flies. Gayev. Who? Lopahin. I say, time flies. Gayev. It smells of patchouli here. Anya. I’m going to bed. Good night, Mamma. (Kisses her mother.) Mme. Ranevskaya. My darling child! (Kisses her hands.) Are you happy to be home? I can’t come to my senses. Anya. Good night, Uncle. Gayev (kissing her face and hands). God bless you, how like your mother you are! (To his sister.) At her age, Luba, you were just like her. anya shakes hands with lopahin and pishchik , then goes out, shut ting the door behind her . Mme. Ranevskaya. She’s very tired. Pishchik. Well, it was a long journey. Varya (to lopahin and pishchik). How about it, gentlemen? It’s past two o’clock—isn’t it time for you to go? Mme. Ranevskaya (laughs). You’re just the same as ever, Varya. (Draws her close and kisses her.) I’ll have my coffee and then we’ll all go. (firs puts a small cushion under her feet.) Thank you, my dear. I’ve got used to coffee. I drink it day and night. Thanks, my dear old man. (Kisses him.) Varya. I’d better see if all the luggage has been brought in. (Exits.) Mme. Ranevskaya. Can it really be I sitting here? (Laughs.) I feel like dancing, waving my arms about. (Covers her face with her hands.) But maybe I am dreaming! God knows I love my country, I love it tenderly; I couldn’t look out of the window in the train, I kept crying so. (Through tears.) But I must have my coffee. Thank you, Firs, thank you, dear old man. I’m so happy that you’re still alive. Firs. Day before yesterday. Gayev. He’s hard of hearing. Lopahin. I must go soon, I’m leaving for Kharkov about five o’clock. How annoying! I’d like to have a good look at you, talk to you…You’re just as splendid as ever. Pishchik (breathing heavily). She’s even better looking…. Dressed in the latest Paris fashion…. Perish my carriage and all its four wheels…. Lopahin. Your brother, Leonid Andreyevich, says I’m a vulgarian and an exploiter. But it’s all the same to me—let him talk. I only want you to trust me as you used to. I want you to look at me with your touching, wonderful eyes, as you used to. Dear God! My father was a serf of your father’s and grandfather’s, but you, you yourself, did so much for me once…so much…that I’ve forgotten all about that; I love you as though you were my sister—even more. Mme. Ranevskaya. I can’t sit still, I simply can’t. (Jumps up and walks about in violent agitation.) This joy is too much for me…. Laugh at me, I’m silly! My own darling bookcase! My darling table! (Kisses it.) Gayev. While you were away, nurse died. Mme. Ranevskaya (sits down and takes her coffee). Yes, God rest her soul; they wrote me about it. Gayev. And Anastasy is dead. Petrushka Kossoy has left me and has gone into town to work for the police inspector. (Takes a box of sweets out of his pocket and begins to suck one.) Pishchik. My daughter Dashenka sends her regards. Lopahin. I’d like to tell you something very pleasant—cheering. (Glanc ing at his watch.) I am leaving directly. There isn’t much time to talk. But I will put it in a few words. As you know, your cherry orchard is to be sold to pay your debts. The sale is to be on the twenty-second of August; but don’t you worry, my dear, you may sleep in peace; there is a way out. Here is my plan. Give me your attention! Your estate is only fifteen miles from the town; the railway runs close by it; and if the cherry orchard and the land along the river bank were cut up into lots and these leased for summer cottages, you would have an income of at least 25,000 rubles a year out of it. Gayev. Excuse me…. What nonsense. Mme. Ranevskaya. I don’t quite understand you, Yermolay Alexeyevich. Lopahin. You will get an annual rent of at least ten rubles per acre, and if you advertise at once, I’ll give you any guarantee you like that you won’t have a square foot of ground left by autumn, all the lots will be snapped up. In short, congratulations, you’re saved. The location is splendid—by that deep river…. Only, of course, the ground must be cleared…all the old buildings, for instance, must be torn down, and this house, too, which is useless, and, of course, the old cherry orchard must be cut down. Mme. Ranevskaya. Cut down? My dear, forgive me, but you don’t know what you’re talking about. If there’s one thing that’s interesting—indeed, remarkable—in the whole province, it’s precisely our cherry orchard. Lopahin. The only remarkable thing
