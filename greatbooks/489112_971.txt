so mournful to think of; it gives me so much concern, that—. No, devil take it, it is ridiculous to care about it! They have called me an enemy of the people, so an enemy of the people let me be! Mrs. Stockmann. You will never be that, Thomas. Dr. Stockmann. Don’t swear to that, Katherine. To be called an ugly name may have the same effect as a pin scratch in the lung. And that hateful name—I can’t get quit of it. It is sticking here in the pit of my stomach, eating into me like a corrosive acid. And no magnesia will remove it. Petra. Bah!—you should only laugh at them, father. Horster. They will change their minds some day, Doctor. Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, Thomas, as sure as you are standing here. Dr. Stockmann. Perhaps, when it is too late. Much good may it do them! They may wallow in their filth then and rue the day when they drove a patriot into exile. When do you sail, Captain Horster? Horster. Hm!—that was just what I had come to speak about— Dr. Stockmann. Why, has anything gone wrong with the ship? Horster. No; but what has happened is that I am not to sail in it. Petra. Do you mean that you have been dismissed from your command? Horster (smiling). Yes, that’s just it. Petra. You too. Mrs. Stockmann. There, you see, Thomas! Dr. Stockmann. And that for the truth’s sake! Oh, if I had thought such a thing possible— Horster. You mustn’t take it to heart; I shall be sure to find a job with some shipowner or other, elsewhere. Dr. Stockmann. And that is this man Vik—a wealthy man, independent of everyone and everything—! Shame on him! Horster. He is quite an excellent fellow otherwise; he told me himself he would willingly have kept me on, if only he had dared— Dr. Stockmann. But he didn’t dare? No, of course not. Horster. It is not such an easy matter, he said, for a party man— Dr. Stockmann. The worthy man spoke the truth. A party is like a sausage machine; it mashes up all sorts of heads together into the same mincemeat—fatheads and blockheads, all in one mash! Mrs. Stockmann. Come, come, Thomas dear! Petra (to horster). If only you had not come home with us, things might not have come to this pass. Horster. I do not regret it. Petra (holding out her hand to him). Thank you for that! Horster (to dr. stockmann). And so what I came to say was that if you are determined to go away, I have thought of another plan— Dr. Stockmann. That’s splendid!—if only we can get away at once. Mrs. Stockmann. Hush!—wasn’t that some one knocking? Petra. That is uncle, surely. Dr. Stockmann. Aha! (Calls out.) Come in! Mrs. Stockmann. Dear Thomas, promise me definitely— peter stockmann comes in from the hall . Peter Stockmann. Oh, you are engaged. In that case, I will— Dr. Stockmann. No, no, come in. Peter Stockmann. But I wanted to speak to you alone. Mrs. Stockmann. We will go into the sitting room in the meanwhile. Horster. And I will look in again later. Dr. Stockmann. No, go in there with them, Captain Horster; I want to hear more about— Horster. Very well, I will wait, then. (He follows mrs. stockmann and petra into the sitting room.) Dr. Stockmann. I daresay you find it rather drafty here today. Put your hat on. Peter Stockmann. Thank you, if I may. (Does so.) I think I caught cold last night; I stood and shivered— Dr. Stockmann. Really? I found it warm enough. Peter Stockmann. I regret that it was not in my power to prevent those excesses last night. Dr. Stockmann. Have you anything particular to say to me besides that? Peter Stockmann (taking a big letter from his pocket). I have this document for you, from the Baths Committee. Dr. Stockmann. My dismissal? Peter Stockmann. Yes, dating from today. (Lays the letter on the table.) It gives us pain to do it; but, to speak frankly, we dared not do otherwise on account of public opinion. Dr. Stockmann (smiling). Dared not? I seem to have heard that word before, today. Peter Stockmann. I must beg you to understand your position clearly. For the future you must not count on any practice whatever in the town. Dr. Stockmann. Devil take the practice! But why are you so sure of that? Peter Stockmann. The Householders’ Association is circulating a list from house to house. All right-minded citizens are being called upon to give up employing you; and I can assure you that not a single head of a family will risk refusing his signature. They simply dare not. Dr. Stockmann. No, no; I don’t doubt it. But what then? Peter Stockmann. If I might advise you, it would be best to leave the place for a little while— Dr. Stockmann. Yes, the propriety of leaving the place has occurred to me. Peter Stockmann. Good. And then, when you have had six months to think things over, if, after mature consideration, you can persuade yourself to write a few words of regret, acknowledging your error— Dr. Stockmann. I might have my appointment restored to me, do you mean? Peter Stockmann. Perhaps. It is not at all impossible. Dr. Stockmann. But what about public opinion, then? Surely you would not dare to do it on account of public feeling. Peter Stockmann. Public opinion is an extremely mutable thing. And, to be quite candid with you, it is a matter of great importance to us to have some admission of that sort from you in writing. Dr. Stockmann. Oh, that’s what you are after, is it! I will just trouble you to remember what I said to you lately about foxy tricks of that sort! Peter Stockmann. Your position was quite different then. At that time you had reason to suppose you had the whole town at your back— Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and now I feel I have the whole town on my back—(flaring up). I would not do it if I had the devil and his dam on my back—! Never—never, I tell you! Peter Stockmann. A man with a family has no right to behave as you do. You have no right to do it, Thomas. Dr. Stockmann. I have no right! There is only one single thing in the world a free man has no right to do. Do you know what that is? Peter Stockmann. No. Dr. Stockmann. Of course you don’t, but I will tell you. A free man has no right to soil himself with filth; he has no right to behave in a way that would justify his spitting in his own face. Peter Stockmann. This sort of thing sounds extremely plausible, of course; and if there were no other explanation for your obstinacy—. But as it happens that there is— Dr. Stockmann. What do you mean? Peter Stockmann. You understand very well what I mean. But, as your brother and as a man of discretion, I advise you not to build too much upon expectations and prospects that may so very easily fail you. Dr. Stockmann. What in the world is all this about? Peter Stockmann. Do you really ask me to believe that you are ignorant of the terms of Mr. Kiil’s will? Dr. Stockmann. I know that the small amount he possesses is to go to an institution for indigent old workpeople. How does that concern me? Peter Stockmann. In the first place, it is by no means a small amount that is in question. Mr. Kiil is a fairly wealthy man. Dr. Stockmann. I had no notion of that! Peter Stockmann. Hm!—hadn’t you really? Then I suppose you had no notion, either, that a considerable portion of his wealth will come to your children, you and your wife having a liferent of the capital. Has he never told you so? Dr. Stockmann. Never, on my honor! Quite the reverse; he has consistently done nothing but fume at being so unconscionably heavily taxed. But are you perfectly certain of this, Peter? Peter Stockmann. I have it from an absolutely reliable source. Dr. Stockmann. Then, thank God, Katherine is provided for—and the children too! I must tell her this at once—(calls out) Katherine, Katherine! Peter Stockmann (restraining him). Hush, don’t say a word yet! Mrs. Stockmann (opening the door). What is the matter? Dr. Stockmann. Oh, nothing, nothing; you can go back. (She shuts the door. dr. stockmann walks up and down in his excitement.) Provided for!—Just think of it, we are all provided for. And for life! What a blessed feeling it is to know one is provided for! Peter Stockmann. Yes, but that is just exactly what you are not. Mr. Kiil can alter his will any day he likes. Dr. Stockmann. But he won’t do that, my dear Peter. “The Badger” is much too delighted
