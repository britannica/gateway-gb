I don’t pity Sir Peter at all—he was so extravagantly partial to Mr. Surface. Mrs. Candour. Mr. Surface! Why, ’twas with Charles Lady Teazle was detected. Sir Benjamin. No such thing—Mr. Surface is the gallant. Mrs. Candour. No, no—Charles is the man. ’Twas Mr. Surface brought Sir Peter on purpose to discover them. Sir Benjamin. I tell you I have it from one— Mrs. Candour. And I have it from one— Sir Benjamin. Who had it from one, who had it— Mrs. Candour. From one immediately—But here’s Lady Sneerwell; perhaps she knows the whole affair. Enter lady sneerwell Lady Sneerwell. So, my dear Mrs. Candour, here’s a sad affair of our friend Lady Teazle! Mrs. Candour. Aye, my dear friend, who could have thought it— Lady Sneerwell. Well, there’s no trusting appearances; though, indeed, she was always too lively for me. Mrs. Candour. To be sure, her manners were a little too free—but she was very young! Lady Sneerwell. And had, indeed, some good qualities. Mrs. Candour. So she had, indeed. But have you heard the particulars? Lady Sneerwell. No; but everybody says that Mr. Surface— Sir Benjamin. Aye, there, I told you—Mr. Surface was the man. Mrs. Candour. No, no, indeed—the assignation was with Charles. Lady Sneerwell. With Charles! You alarm me, Mrs. Candour. Mrs. Candour. Yes, yes, he was the lover. Mr. Surface—do him justice— was only the informer. Sir Benjamin. Well, I’ll not dispute with you, Mrs. Candour; but, be it which it may, I hope that Sir Peter’s wound will not— Mrs. Candour. Sir Peter’s wound! Oh, mercy! I didn’t hear a word of their fighting. Lady Sneerwell. Nor I, a syllable. Sir Benjamin. No! what, no mention of the duel? Mrs. Candour. Not a word. Sir Benjamin. O Lord—yes, yes—they fought before they left the room. Lady Sneerwell. Pray let us hear. Mrs. Candour. Aye, do oblige us with the duel. Sir Benjamin. “Sir,” says Sir Peter—immediately after the discovery— “you are a most ungrateful fellow.” Mrs. Candour. Aye, to Charles— Sir Benjamin. No, no—to Mr. Surface—“a most ungrateful fellow; and old as I am, sir,” says he, “I insist on immediate satisfaction.” Mrs. Candour. Aye, that must have been to Charles; for ’tis very unlikely Mr. Surface should go to fight in his house. Sir Benjamin. ’Gad’s life, ma’am, not at all—“giving me immediate satisfaction.” On this, madam, Lady Teazle, seeing Sir Peter in such danger, ran out of the room in strong hysterics, and Charles after her, calling out for hartshorn and water! Then, madam, they began to fight with swords— Enter crabtree. Crabtree. With pistols, nephew—I have it from undoubted authority. Mrs. Candour. O Mr. Crabtree, then it is all true! Crabtree. Too true, indeed, ma’am, and Sir Peter’s dangerously wounded— Sir Benjamin. By a thrust of in seconde quite through his left side— Crabtree. By a bullet lodged in the thorax. Mrs. Candour. Mercy on me! Poor Sir Peter! Crabtree. Yes, ma’am—though Charles would have avoided the matter, if he could. Mrs. Candour. I knew Charles was the person. Sir Benjamin. Oh, my uncle, I see, knows nothing of the matter. Crabtree. But Sir Peter taxed him with the basest ingratitude— Sir Benjamin. That I told you, you know. Crabtree. Do, nephew, let me speak!—and insisted on an immediate— Sir Benjamin. Just as I said. Crabtree. Odds life, nephew, allow others to know something too! A pair of pistols lay on the bureau (for Mr. Surface, it seems, had come the night before late from Salt-Hill, where he had been to see the Montem with a friend, who has a son at Eton), so, unluckily, the pistols were left charged. Sir Benjamin. I heard nothing of this. Crabtree. Sir Peter forced Charles to take one, and they fired, it seems, pretty nearly together. Charles’s shot took place, as I told you, and Sir Peter’s missed; but, what is very extraordinary, the ball struck against a little bronze Pliny that stood over the chimney-piece, grazed out of the window at a right angle, and wounded the postman, who was just coming to the door with a double letter from Northamptonshire. Sir Benjamin. My uncle’s account is more circumstantial, I must confess; but I believe mine is the true one, for all that. Lady Sneerwell (aside). I am more interested in this affair than they imagine, and must have better information. (Exit lady sneerwell.) Sir Benjamin (after a pause looking at each other). Ah! Lady Sneerwell’s alarm is very easily accounted for. Crabtree. Yes, yes, they certainly do say—but that’s neither here nor there. Mrs. Candour. But, pray, where is Sir Peter at present? Crabtree. Oh! they brought him home, and he is now in the house, though the servants are ordered to deny it. Mrs. Candour. I believe so, and Lady Teazle, I suppose, attending him. Crabtree. Yes, yes; I saw one of the faculty enter just before me. Sir Benjamin. Hey! who comes here? Crabtree. Oh, this is he—the physician, depend on’t. Mrs. Candour. Oh, certainly! it must be the physician; and now we shall know. Enter sir oliver surface. Crabtree. Well, doctor, what hopes? Mrs. Candour. Aye, doctor, how’s your patient? Sir Benjamin. Now, doctor, isn’t it a wound with a small-sword? Crabtree. A bullet lodged in the thorax, for a hundred! Sir Oliver. Doctor! a wound with a small-sword! and a bullet in the thorax? Oons! are you mad, good people? Sir Benjamin. Perhaps, sir, you are not a doctor? Sir Oliver. Truly, I am to thank you for my degree, if I am. Crabtree. Only a friend of Sir Peter’s, then, I presume. But, sir, you must have heard of this accident? Sir Oliver. Not a word! Crabtree. Not of his being dangerously wounded? Sir Oliver. The devil he is! Sir Benjamin. Run through the body— Crabtree. Shot in the breast— Sir Benjamin. By one Mr. Surface— Crabtree. Aye, the younger. Sir Oliver. Hey! what the plague! you seem to differ strangely in your accounts—however, you agree that Sir Peter is dangerously wounded. Sir Benjamin. Oh, yes, we agree there. Crabtree. Yes, yes, I believe there can be no doubt of that. Sir Oliver. Then, upon my word, for a person in that situation, he is the most imprudent man alive—for here he comes, walking as if nothing at all were the matter. Enter sir peter teazle. Odds heart, Sir Peter! you are come in good time, I promise you; for we had just given you over. Sir Benjamin. Egad, uncle, this is the most sudden recovery! Sir Oliver. Why, man! what do you do out of bed with a small-sword through your body, and a bullet lodged in your thorax? Sir Peter. A small-sword and a bullet? Sir Oliver. Aye; these gentlemen would have killed you without law or physic, and wanted to dub me a doctor—to make me an accomplice Sir Peter. Why, what is all this? Sir Benjamin. We rejoice, Sir Peter, that the story of the duel is not true and are sincerely sorry for your other misfortunes. Sir Peter. So; so; all over the town already. (Aside.) Crabtree. Though, Sir Peter, you were certainly vastly to blame to marry at all, at your years. Sir Peter. Sir, what business is that of yours? Mrs. Candour. Though, indeed, as Sir Peter made so good a husband, he’s very much to be pitied. Sir Peter. Plague on your pity, ma’am! I desire none of it. Sir Benjamin. However, Sir Peter, you must not mind the laughing and jests you will meet with on this occasion. Sir Peter. Sir, I desire to be master in my own house. Crabtree. ’Tis no uncommon case, that’s one comfort. Sir Peter. I insist on being left to myself: without ceremony, I insist on your leaving my house directly! Mrs. Candour. Well, well, we are going; and depend on’t, we’ll make the best report of you we can. Sir Peter. Leave my house! Crabtree. And tell how hardly you have been treated. Sir Peter. Leave my house! Sir Benjamin. And how patiently you bear it. Sir Peter. Fiends! vipers! furies! Oh! that their own venom would choke them! (Exeunt mrs. candour, sir benjamin backbite, crabtree, etc.) Sir Oliver. They are very provoking indeed, Sir Peter. Enter rowley. Rowley. I heard high words—what has ruffled you, Sir Peter? Sir Peter. Pshaw! what signifies asking? Do I ever pass a day without my vexations? Sir Oliver. Well, I’m not inquisitive—I come only to tell you that I have seen both my nephews in the manner we proposed. Sir Peter. A precious couple they are! Rowley. Yes, and Sir Oliver is convinced that your judgment was right, Sir Peter. Sir Oliver. Yes, I find Joseph is indeed the man, after all. Rowley. Yes, as Sir Peter says, he’s a man of sentiment. Sir Oliver. And acts up to the sentiments he professes. Rowley. It certainly is edification to hear him talk. Sir Oliver. Oh, he’s a model for the young men of the
