be a wonderful day tomorrow. What a blue sky! What a moon! Look at that yellow cloud about to veil the moon. Look at it! look at it—no, it has just missed the moon. Look at it—look!” But Nastenka wasn’t looking at the cloud. She stood still as a tree. Then, after a while, she pressed herself against me in a strange way. Her hand was trembling in mine. I looked at her. She pressed herself even closer to me. At that moment, a young man was passing nearby. Suddenly he stopped and gave us a close, scrutinizing look. Then he walked a few more steps. My heart throbbed. “Nastenka,” I said very softly, “who is it, Nastenka?” “It’s him!” she whispered, pressing herself even more closely to me. I could hardly keep my feet. “Nastenka, Nastenka, is that you?” I heard a voice behind us, and the young man came toward us. My God, that cry! The shiver that passed through her! She tore herself from my arm and rushed toward him. I stood staring at them. I was dead. But she hardly had time to seize his hand and fling herself into his arms before she turned her head and looked at me. Then, with the speed of lightning, she was by me, her arms were around my neck, and before I knew what had happened, I felt her passionate kiss. Still without uttering a word, she again rushed toward him, caught his hand, and hurried away with him. For a long time I kept following them with my eyes… Finally they vanished from sight.
