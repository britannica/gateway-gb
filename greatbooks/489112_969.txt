worst. Morten Kiil. Are you going to put that in the papers? Dr. Stockmann. I shall conceal nothing. Morten Kiil. That may cost you dear, Stockmann. (Goes out.) A Stout Man (going up to captain horster, without taking any notice of the ladies). Well, Captain, so you lend your house to enemies of the people? Horster. I imagine I can do what I like with my own possessions, Mr. Vik. The Stout Man. Then you can have no objection to my doing the same with mine. Horster. What do you mean, sir? The Stout Man. You shall hear from me in the morning. (Turns his back on him and moves off.) Petra. Was that not your owner, Captain Horster? Horster. Yes, that was Mr. Vik the shipowner. Aslaksen (with the voting papers in his hands, gets up on to the platform and rings his bell). Gentlemen, allow me to announce the result. By the votes of every one here except one person— A Young Man. That is the drunk chap! Aslaksen. By the votes of every one here except a tipsy man, this meeting of citizens declares Dr. Thomas Stockmann to be an enemy of the people. (Shouts and applause.) Three cheers for our ancient and honorable citizen community! (Renewed applause.) Three cheers for our able and energetic Mayor, who has so loyally suppressed the promptings of family feeling! (Cheers.) The meeting is dissolved. (Gets down.) Billing. Three cheers for the Chairman! The whole crowd. Three cheers for Aslaksen! Hurrah! Dr. Stockmann. My hat and coat, Petra! Captain, have you room on your ship for passengers to the New World? Horster. For you and yours we will make room, Doctor. Dr. Stockmann (as petra helps him into his coat). Good. Come, Katherine! Come, boys! Mrs. Stockmann (in an undertone). Thomas, dear, let us go out by the back way. Dr. Stockmann. No back ways for me, Katherine. (Raising his voice.) You will hear more of this enemy of the people, before he shakes the dust off his shoes upon you! I am not so forgiving as a certain Person; I do not say: “I forgive you, for ye know not what ye do.” Aslaksen (shouting). That is a blasphemous comparison, Dr. Stockmann! Billing. It is, by God! It’s dreadful for an earnest man to listen to. A Coarse Voice. Threatens us now, does he! Other Voices (excitedly). Let’s go and break his windows! Duck him in the fjord! Another Voice. Blow your horn, Evensen. Pip, pip! Horn-blowing, hisses, and wild cries. dr. stockmann goes out through the hall with his family, horster elbowing a way for them . The Whole Crowd (howling after them as they go). Enemy of the People! Enemy of the People! Billing (as he puts his papers together). Well, I’m damned if I go and drink toddy with the Stockmanns tonight! The crowd press towards the exit. The uproar continues outside; shouts of “Enemy of the People!” are heard from without .
