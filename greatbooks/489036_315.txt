about this orchard is that it’s a very large one. There’s a crop of cherries every other year, and you can’t do anything with them; no one buys them. Gayev. This orchard is even mentioned in the Encyclopedia. Lopahin (glancing at his watch). If we can’t think of a way out, if we don’t come to a decision, on the twenty-second of August the cherry orchard and the whole estate will be sold at auction. Make up your minds! There’s no other way out—I swear. None, none. Firs. In the old days, forty or fifty years ago, the cherries were dried, soaked, pickled, and made into jam, and we used to— Gayev. Keep still, Firs. Firs. And the dried cherries would be shipped by the cartload. It meant a lot of money! And in those days the dried cherries were soft and juicy, sweet, fragrant…. They knew the way to do it, then. Mme. Ranevskaya. And why don’t they do it that way now? Firs. They’ve forgotten. Nobody remembers it. Pishchik (to mme. ranevskaya). What’s doing in Paris? Eh? Did you eat frogs there? Mme. Ranevskaya. I ate crocodiles. Pishchik. Just imagine! Lopahin. There used to be only landowners and peasants in the country, but now these summer people have appeared on the scene…. All the towns, even the small ones, are surrounded by these summer cottages; and in another twenty years, no doubt, the summer population will have grown enormously. Now the summer resident only drinks tea on his porch, but maybe he’ll take to working his acre, too, and then your cherry orchard will be a rich, happy, luxuriant place. Gayev (indignantly). Poppycock! Enter varya and yasha . Varya. There are two telegrams for you, Mamma dear. (Picks a key from the bunch at her belt and noisily opens an old-fashioned bookcase.) Here they are. Mme. Ranevskaya. They’re from Paris. (Tears them up without reading them.) I’m through with Paris. Gayev. Do you know, Luba, how old this bookcase is? Last week I pulled out the bottom drawer and there I found the date burned in it. It was made exactly a hundred years ago. Think of that! We could celebrate its centenary. True, it’s an inanimate object, but nevertheless, a bookcase… Pishchik (amazed). A hundred years! Just imagine! Gayev. Yes. (Tapping it.) That’s something…. Dear, honored bookcase, hail to you who for more than a century have served the glorious ideals of goodness and justice! Your silent summons to fruitful toil has never weakened in all those hundred years (through tears), sustaining, through successive generations of our family, courage and faith in a better future, and fostering in us ideals of goodness and social consciousness…. (Pauses.) Lopahin. Yes… Mme. Ranevskaya. You haven’t changed a bit, Leonid. Gayev (somewhat embarrassed). I’ll play it off the red in the corner! Tip it in the side pocket! Lopahin (looking at his watch). Well, it’s time for me to go… Yasha (handing a pillbox to mme. ranevskaya). Perhaps you’ll take your pills now. Pishchik. One shouldn’t take medicines, dearest lady, they do neither harm nor good…. Give them here, my valued friend. (Takes the pillbox, pours the pills into his palm, blows on them, puts them in his mouth, and washes them down with some kvass.) There! Mme. Ranevskaya (frightened). You must be mad! Pishchik. I’ve taken all the pills. Lopahin. What a glutton! All laugh. Firs. The gentleman visited us in Easter week, ate half a bucket of pickles, he did…(Mumbles.) Mme. Ranevskaya. What’s he saying? Varya. He’s been mumbling like that for the last three years—we’re used to it. Yasha. His declining years! charlotta ivanovna , very thin, tightly laced, dressed in white, a lorgnette at her waist, crosses the stage . Lopahin. Forgive me, Charlotta Ivanovna, I’ve not had time to greet you. (Tries to kiss her hand.) Charlotta (pulling away her hand). If I let you kiss my hand, you’ll be wanting to kiss my elbow next, and then my shoulder. Lopahin. I’ve no luck today. (All laugh.) Charlotta Ivanovna, show us a trick. Mme. Ranevskaya. Yes, Charlotta, do a trick for us. Charlotta. I don’t see the need. I want to sleep. (Exits.) Lopahin. In three weeks we’ll meet again. (Kisses mme. ranevskaya’s hand.) Good-by till then. Time’s up. (To gayev) Bye-bye. (Kisses pishchik.) Bye-bye. (Shakes hands with varya, then with firs and yasha.) I hate to leave. (To mme. ranevskaya) If you make up your mind about the cottages, let me know; I’ll get you a loan of 50,000 rubles. Think it over seriously. Varya (crossly). Will you never go! Lopahin. I’m going, I’m going. (Exits.) Gayev. The vulgarian. But, excuse me…Varya’s going to marry him, he’s Varya’s fiancé. Varya. You talk too much, Uncle dear. Mme. Ranevskaya. Well, Varya, it would make me happy. He’s a good man. Pishchik. Yes, one must admit, he’s a most estimable man. And my Dashenka…she too says that…she says…lots of things (Snores; but wakes up at once.) All the same, my valued friend, could you oblige me…with a loan of 240 rubles? I must pay the interest on the mortgage tomorrow. Varya (alarmed). We can’t, we can’t! Mme. Ranevskaya. I really haven’t any money. Pishchik. It’ll turn up. (Laughs.) I never lose hope, I thought everything was lost, that I was done for, when lo and behold, the railway ran through my land…and I was paid for it…. And something else will turn up again, if not today, then tomorrow…Dashenka will win two hundred thousand…she’s got a lottery ticket. Mme. Ranevskaya. I’ve had my coffee, now let’s go to bed. Firs (brushes off gayev; admonishingly). You’ve got the wrong trousers on again. What am I to do with you? Varya (softly). Anya’s asleep. (Gently opens the window.) The sun’s up now, it’s not a bit cold. Look, Mamma dear, what wonderful trees. And heavens, what air! The starlings are singing! Gayev (opens the other window). The orchard is all white. You’ve not forgotten it? Luba? That’s the long alley that runs straight, straight as an arrow; how it shines on moonlight nights, do you remember? You’ve not forgotten? Mme. Ranevskaya (looking out of the window into the orchard). Oh, my childhood, my innocent childhood. I used to sleep in this nursery—I used to look out into the orchard, happiness waked with me every morning, the orchard was just the same then…nothing has changed. (Laughs with joy.) All, all white! Oh, my orchard! After the dark, rainy autumn and the cold winter, you are young again, and full of happiness, the heavenly angels have not left you…If I could free my chest and my shoulders from this rock that weighs on me, if I could only forget the past! Gayev. Yes, and the orchard will be sold to pay our debts, strange as it may seem…. Mme. Ranevskaya. Look! There is our poor mother walking in the orchard …all in white…(Laughs with joy.) It is she! Gayev. Where? Varya. What are you saying, Mamma dear! Mme. Ranevskaya. There’s no one there, I just imagined it. To the right, where the path turns towards the arbor, there’s a little white tree, leaning over, that looks like a woman…. trofimov enters, wearing a shabby student’s uniform and spectacles . Mme. Ranevskaya. What an amazing orchard! White masses of blossom, the blue sky… Trofimov. Lubov Andreyevna! (She looks round at him.) I just want to pay my respects to you, then I’ll leave at once. (Kisses her hand ardently.) I was told to wait until morning, but I hadn’t the patience…(mme. ranevskaya looks at him, perplexed.) Varya (through tears). This is Petya Trofimov. Trofimov. Petya Trofimov, formerly your Grisha’s tutor…. Can I have changed so much? (mme. ranevskaya embraces him and weeps quietly.) Gayev (embarrassed). Don’t, don’t, Luba. Varya (crying). I told you, Petya, to wait until tomorrow. Mme. Ranevskaya. My Grisha…my little boy…Grisha…my son. Varya. What can one do, Mamma dear, it’s God’s will. Trofimov (softly, through tears). There…there. Mme. Ranevskaya (weeping quietly). My little boy was lost… drowned. Why? Why, my friend? (More quietly.) Anya’s asleep in there, and here I am talking so loudly…making all this noise…. But tell me, Petya, why do you look so badly? Why have you aged so? Trofimov. A mangy master, a peasant woman in the train called me. Mme. Ranevskaya. You were just a boy then, a dear little student, and now your hair’s thin—and you’re wearing glasses! Is it possible you’re still a student? (Goes toward the door.) Trofimov. I suppose I’m a perpetual student. Mme. Ranevskaya (kisses her brother, then varya). Now, go to bed…You have aged, too, Leonid. Pishchik (follows her). So now we turn in. Oh, my gout! I’m staying the night here…Lubov Andreyevna, my angel, tomorrow morning…. I do need 240 rubles. Gayev. He keeps at it. Pishchik. I’ll pay it back, dear…it’s a trifling sum. Mme. Ranevskaya. All right, Leonid will give it to you. Give it to him, Leonid. Gayev. Me give it to him! That’s
