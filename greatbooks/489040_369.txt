Work: What Is War? Field: what is war Author: Karl von Clausewitz Title: FREQUENT PERIODS OF INACTION REMOVE WAR STILL FURTHER FROM THE REALM OF EXACT THEORY AND MAKE IT STILL MORE A CALCULATION OF PROBABILITIES But the more slowly military action proceeds and the longer and more frequent the periods of inaction, so much the more readily can a mistake be repaired, the bolder the commander will thus become in his assumptions, and the more readily will he at the same time remain below the extreme demanded by theory and build everything upon probability and conjecture. So the more or less leisurely course of military action allows more or less time for what the nature of the concrete situation in itself already demands, namely, a calculation of probabilities in accordance with the given circumstances.
