I meant. Petra (suddenly checked). That? Hovstad. Yes, Petra—Miss Petra. Petra. Is it that, that is first and foremost with you? Not the matter itself? Not the truth?—not my father’s big generous heart? Hovstad. Certainly—of course—that too. Petra. No, thank you; you have betrayed yourself, Mr. Hovstad, and now I shall never trust you again in anything. Hovstad. Can you really take it so amiss in me that it is mostly for your sake—? Petra. What I am angry with you for is for not having been honest with my father. You talked to him as if the truth and the good of the community were what lay nearest to your heart. You have made fools of both my father and me. You are not the man you made yourself out to be. And that I shall never forgive you—never! Hovstad. You ought not to speak so bitterly, Miss Petra—least of all now. Petra. Why not now, especially? Hovstad. Because your father cannot do without my help. Petra (looking him up and down). Are you that sort of man too? For shame! Hovstad. No, no, I am not. This came upon me so unexpectedly—you must believe that. Petra. I know what to believe. Good-by. Aslaksen (coming from the printing room, hurriedly and with an air of mystery). Damnation, Hovstad!—(Sees Petra.) Oh, this is awkward— Petra. There is the book; you must give it to some one else. (Goes towards the door.) Hovstad (following her). But, Miss Stockmann— Petra. Good-by. (Goes out.) Aslaksen. I say—Mr. Hovstad— Hovstad. Well, well!—what is it? Aslaksen. The Mayor is outside in the printing room. Hovstad. The Mayor, did you say? Aslaksen. Yes, he wants to speak to you. He came in by the back door—didn’t want to be seen, you understand. Hovstad. What can he want? Wait a bit—I will go myself. (Goes to the door of the printing room, opens it, bows and invites peter stockmann in.) Just see, Aslaksen, that no one— Aslaksen. Quite so. (Goes into the printing room.) Peter Stockmann. You did not expect to see me here, Mr. Hovstad? Hovstad. No, I confess I did not. Peter Stockmann (looking round). You are very snug in here—very nice indeed. Hovstad. Oh— Peter Stockmann. And here I come, without any notice, to take up your time! Hovstad. By all means, Mr. Mayor. I am at your service. But let me relieve you of your—(takes stockmann’s hat and stick and puts them on a chair). Won’t you sit down? Peter Stockmann (sitting down by the table). Thank you. (hovstad sits down.) I have had an extremely annoying experience today, Mr. Hovstad. Hovstad. Really? Ah well, I expect with all the various business you have to attend to— Peter Stockmann. The Medical Officer of the Baths is responsible for what happened today. Hovstad. Indeed? The Doctor? Peter Stockmann. He has addressed a kind of report to the Baths Committee on the subject of certain supposed defects in the Baths. Hovstad. Has he indeed? Peter Stockmann. Yes—has he not told you? I thought he said— Hovstad. Ah, yes—it is true he did mention something about— Aslaksen (coming from the printing room). I ought to have that copy— Hovstad (angrily). Ahem!—there it is on the desk. Aslaksen (taking it). Right. Peter Stockmann. But look there—that is the thing I was speaking of! Aslaksen. Yes, that is the Doctor’s article, Mr. Mayor. Hovstad. Oh, is that what you were speaking about? Peter Stockmann. Yes, that is it. What do you think of it? Hovstad. Oh, I am only a layman—and I have only taken a very cursory glance at it. Peter Stockmann. But you are going to print it? Hovstad. I cannot very well refuse a distinguished man— Aslaksen. I have nothing to do with editing the paper, Mr. Mayor— Peter Stockmann. I understand. Aslaksen. I merely print what is put into my hands. Peter Stockmann. Quite so. Aslaksen. And so I must—(moves off towards the printing room). Peter Stockmann. No, but wait a moment, Mr. Aslaksen. You will allow me, Mr. Hovstad? Hovstad. If you please, Mr. Mayor. Peter Stockmann. You are a discreet and thoughtful man, Mr. Aslaksen. Aslaksen. I am delighted to hear you think so, sir. Peter Stockmann. And a man of very considerable influence. Aslaksen. Chiefly among the small tradesmen, sir. Peter Stockmann. The small taxpayers are the majority—here as everywhere else. Aslaksen. That is true. Peter Stockmann. And I have no doubt you know the general trend of opinion among them, don’t you? Aslaksen. Yes, I think I may say I do, Mr. Mayor. Peter Stockmann. Yes. Well, since there is such a praiseworthy spirit of self-sacrifice among the less wealthy citizens of our town— Aslaksen. What? Hovstad. Self-sacrifice? Peter Stockmann. It is pleasing evidence of a public-spirited feeling, extremely pleasing evidence. I might almost say I hardly expected it. But you have a closer knowledge of public opinion than I. Aslaksen. But, Mr. Mayor— Peter Stockmann. And indeed it is no small sacrifice that the town is going to make. Hovstad. The town? Aslaksen. But I don’t understand. Is it the Baths—? Peter Stockmann. At a provisional estimate, the alterations that the Medical Officer asserts to be desirable will cost somewhere about twenty thousand pounds. Aslaksen. That is a lot of money, but— Peter Stockmann. Of course it will be necessary to raise a municipal loan. Hovstad (getting up). Surely you never mean that the town must pay—? Aslaksen. Do you mean that it must come out of the municipal funds?—out of the ill-filled pockets of the small tradesmen? Peter Stockmann. Well, my dear Mr. Aslaksen, where else is the money to come from? Aslaksen. The gentlemen who own the Baths ought to provide that. Peter Stockmann. The proprietors of the Baths are not in a position to incur any further expense. Aslaksen. Is that absolutely certain, Mr. Mayor? Peter Stockmann. I have satisfied myself that it is so. If the town wants these very extensive alterations, it will have to pay for them. Aslaksen. But, damn it all—I beg your pardon—this is quite another matter, Mr. Hovstad! Hovstad. It is, indeed. Peter Stockmann. The most fatal part of it is that we shall be obliged to shut the Baths for a couple of years. Hovstad. Shut them? Shut them altogether? Aslaksen. For two years? Peter Stockmann. Yes, the work will take as long as that—at least. Aslaksen. I’m damned if we will stand that, Mr. Mayor! What are we householders to live upon in the meantime? Peter Stockmann. Unfortunately that is an extremely difficult question to answer, Mr. Aslaksen. But what would you have us do? Do you suppose we shall have a single visitor in the town, if we go about proclaiming that our water is polluted, that we are living over a plague spot, that the entire town— Aslaksen. And the whole thing is merely imagination? Peter Stockmann. With the best will in the world, I have not been able to come to any other conclusion. Aslaksen. Well then I must say it is absolutely unjustifiable of Dr. Stockmann—I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor— Peter Stockmann. What you say is lamentably true, Mr. Aslaksen. My brother has unfortunately always been a headstrong man. Aslaksen. After this, do you mean to give him your support, Mr. Hovstad? Hovstad. Can you suppose for a moment that I—? Peter Stockmann. I have drawn up a short résumé of the situation as it appears from a reasonable man’s point of view. In it I have indicated how certain possible defects might suitably be remedied without outrunning the resources of the Baths Committee. Hovstad. Have you got it with you, Mr. Mayor? Peter Stockmann (fumbling in his pocket). Yes, I brought it with me in case you should— Aslaksen. Good Lord, there he is! Peter Stockmann. Who? My brother? Hovstad. Where? Where? Aslaksen. He has just gone through the printing room. Peter Stockmann. How unlucky! I don’t want to meet him here, and I had still several things to speak to you about. Hovstad (pointing to the door on the right). Go in there for the present. Peter Stockmann. But—? Hovstad. You will only find Billing in there. Aslaksen. Quick, quick, Mr. Mayor—he is just coming. Peter Stockmann. Yes, very well; but see that you get rid of him quickly. (Goes out through the door on the right, which aslaksen opens for him and shuts after him.) Hovstad. Pretend to be doing something, Aslaksen. (Sits down and writes. aslaksen begins foraging among a heap of newspapers that are lying on a chair.) Dr. Stockmann (coming in from the printing room). Here I am again. (Puts down his hat and stick.) Hovstad (writing). Already, Doctor? Hurry up with what we were speaking about, Aslaksen. We are very pressed for time today. Dr. Stockmann (to aslaksen). No proof for me to see yet, I hear. Aslaksen (without turning round). You couldn’t expect it yet, Doctor. Dr. Stockmann. No, no; but I am impatient, as
