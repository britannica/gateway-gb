Work: Characters Field: characters Author: La Bruy√®re Title: GITON Giton has a fresh complexion, a full face and bulging cheeks, a fixed and assured gaze, broad shoulders, a projecting stomach, a firm and deliberate tread. He speaks with confidence; he makes those who converse with him repeat what they have said and he only moderately enjoys what is said. He unfolds an ample handkerchief and blows his nose noisily; he spits to a great distance and sneezes very loudly. He sleeps by day, he sleeps by night; he snores in company. At table and in walking he occupies more room than anyone else. He takes the centre and walks with his equals; he stops and they stop; he walks on and they walk on; all regulate themselves by him. He interrupts and corrects those who are talking; he is not interrupted, he is listened to as long as he likes to talk; his opinion is accepted, the rumours he spreads are believed. If he sits down you will see him settle into an arm-chair, cross his legs, frown, pull his hat over his eyes and see no one, or lift it up again and show his brow from pride and audacity. He is cheerful, a hearty laugher, impatient, presumptuous, quick to anger, irreligious, politic, mysterious about current affairs; he believes he has talents and wit. He is rich.
